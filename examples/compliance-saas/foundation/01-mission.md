## Mission Components

### Who We Serve
- **Primary User**: Compliance officers at regulated firms (financial services, healthcare, SaaS)
- **User Context**: Review 20-50 documents monthly against multiple regulatory frameworks
- **Why They Need This**: Manual review takes 2-4 hours per document, creates bottlenecks, risks errors

### Value We Deliver
- **Core Outcome**: Reduce document review time from hours to minutes
- **Measurable Impact**: 10x faster assessments with 95%+ accuracy
- **Journey Connection**: Delivers value at Step 3 (AI Assessment) - the core "aha moment"

### How We're Different
- **Unique Approach**: We don't just flag keywords - we reason about compliance requirements like an expert reviewer
- **Why It Works**: Claude's deep reasoning + regulatory framework mapping = contextual compliance analysis
- **Why It's Defensible**: Proprietary framework database + continuous learning from user feedback
