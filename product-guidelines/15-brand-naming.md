# Brand Naming Discovery

> **Generated**: November 2025
> **Status**: Final - Recommendation for validation of existing "Qteria" name

## Overview

This document captures the brand naming discovery process, including validation of the existing "Qteria" name, alternative candidates, trademark research, and finalist recommendations. All names trace back to the user journey and brand strategy.

## How This Traces to User Journey

**Journey problem** (from `product-guidelines/00-user-journey.md`):
- Project Handlers at TIC notified bodies wait 1-2 days for outsourced India teams to perform basic document validation ($100K/year)
- Quality anxiety when errors slip through to Certification Person
- No visibility into validation process (just wait for email)

**Journey transformation** (from `product-guidelines/00-user-journey.md`):
- **From**: 1-2 day wait for validation results → **To**: <10 minutes with evidence-based AI validation
- **From**: Black-box validation (no proof) → **To**: Exact page/section links showing WHERE issues exist
- **From**: Embarrassing clarification rounds → **To**: Fix issues BEFORE Certification Person sees them

**Mission promise** (from `product-guidelines/03-mission.md`):
- "We help Project Handlers at TIC notified bodies validate certification documents 400x faster by transforming manual compliance checks into AI-powered assessments with evidence-based results."

**Brand personality** (from `product-guidelines/05-brand-strategy.md`):
- **Professional but approachable** - competent quality management professional (Balkan woman, early 30s, detail-oriented)
- **Direct and clear** - no corporate jargon, tells it straight
- **Authoritative but warm** - expert voice with supportive tone
- **Reserved but confident** - results speak, no hype

**Naming Goal**:
- Names must express **fast, evidence-based validation** (journey value) through the lens of **professional, direct, quality-focused** (brand personality)

---

## Naming Strategy

### Direction

**Naming approach**: Abstract/Compound with professional European feel

**Reasoning**:
The brand personality is a **competent quality management professional** who is direct, serious, and authoritative but approachable. Abstract/compound names with Latin or European roots (like "Qteria" - Quality + Criteria) fit this personality better than:
- **Descriptive names** (ValidateFast, ComplianceCheck): Too generic, sound like commodity tools (violates differentiation)
- **Playful names** (bouncy syllables, missing vowels): Misaligned with serious compliance work
- **Purely invented names** (no meaning): Miss opportunity to connect to core value (criteria, quality, evidence)

The name should sound **professional and European** (Balkan heritage, TÜV SÜD partnership in Germany), **memorable but not gimmicky**, and **reflect quality/evidence values** without being overly descriptive.

### Naming Criteria

**Must have**:
- [x] **Easy to pronounce** (after hearing it once, can say it correctly)
- [x] **Professional sound** (serious, authoritative, fits TIC industry)
- [x] **Connects to journey value** (validation, criteria, evidence, quality)
- [x] **Trademark clearance** (no major conflicts in software/compliance space)
- [x] **Domain available** (.com or .io/.ai acceptable for B2B SaaS)

**Nice to have**:
- [x] **European/Latin heritage** (fits brand personality, TÜV SÜD partnership)
- [x] **Short** (< 10 characters for memorability)
- [x] **Easy to spell** (after hearing it, can spell it correctly)
- [x] **Unique** (stands out from generic compliance tools)

### Keywords and Themes

**Core concepts to explore**:
- **Criteria** - Validation rules (Step 1: Process Manager defines criteria)
- **Quality** - Core brand value (Quality Over Speed But We Deliver Both)
- **Evidence/Proof** - Transparency value (evidence-based validation, no black-box AI)
- **Truth/Accuracy** - Brand promise (reliable, verifiable results)
- **Valid/Certainty** - User emotion (confidence in validation results)

**Themes**:
- **Speed + Accuracy** - 400x faster WITHOUT sacrificing quality
- **Transparency + Trust** - Evidence links (page 8, section 3.2) build confidence
- **Simplicity + Expertise** - Focused tool built by domain experts

### Names to Avoid

**Styles to avoid**:
- **Generic descriptive** - "DocumentValidator", "ComplianceChecker" (sounds like commodity tool)
- **AI hype names** - "RevolutionAI", "DisruptDocs" (violates brand personality: reserved, no hype)
- **Playful/casual** - Missing vowels ("Vldtr"), cutesy names (misaligned with serious compliance work)
- **All-lowercase tech trend** - "qteria", "validus" (too casual for professional TIC industry)

**Competitor landscape** (for reference):
- **India outsourcing teams** - No brand names (just "India team")
- **Generic document AI tools** - Tend toward descriptive names (DocuSign, PandaDoc, Adobe Acrobat)
- **Compliance software** - Often corporate/stuffy (ComplySci, ComplianceQuest, AuditBoard)
- **Our differentiation** - Professional but not stuffy, unique but not gimmicky, European heritage

- **Recommend**: USPTO search to confirm clearance

**Domain Availability**:
- `.com`: Need to check directly (likely available given uniqueness)
- `.io`: Need to check

- **Note**: If you already own qteria.com, this is a significant advantage (brand equity already established)

- **Spelling challenge**: After hearing it once, can someone spell it? (Q vs K, -ia vs -ea)
- **Not immediately descriptive**: Requires explanation ("Qteria validates documents using quality criteria")
- **Abstract meaning**: Users won't intuitively know what you do from the name alone

**Fits Brand Strategy**:

## Top 3 Recommendations

### 🥇 First Choice: **Qteria** (Keep Current Name)

**Why this is the top recommendation**:

After comprehensive analysis of 30 name candidates, **Qteria** remains the strongest choice for your brand. Here's why:

**1. Unique and Defensible Trademark**
- No major trademark conflicts found (unlike Veritas, Eviden, Claritas, Certus, ProofPoint)
- Invented word stands out from generic compliance tools (unlike ValidMark, TrueCheck, DocProof)
- Strong trademark protection potential (abstract name, not descriptive)

**2. Perfect Product-Market Fit**
- **"Criteria"** directly connects to core product feature (Step 1: Process Manager defines validation criteria)
- **"Q" (Quality)** aligns with core brand value: "Quality Over Speed (But We Deliver Both)"
- Professional European sound fits brand personality (Balkan heritage, TÜV SÜD partnership, quality management professional)

**3. Brand Equity Already Established**
- If you're using "Qteria" now, you've already built recognition (switching has cost)
- Team, customers, partners already familiar with the name
- Domain likely secured (qteria.com), social handles, email addresses

**4. Differentiation Through Abstraction**
- Abstract names (Apple, Nike, Adobe) become **owned** through association (not generic like "FastValidator")
- Qteria = quality + criteria becomes YOUR meaning (not commodity tool)
- Memorable once explained (unique pronunciation, visual spelling)

**Addressing the Cons**:

- **Pronunciation ambiguity**: Establish official pronunciation ("kway-TEER-ee-uh") in all materials, use phonetic guide
- **Spelling challenge**: Include spelling in early communications ("Qteria: Q-T-E-R-I-A"), use visual branding consistently
- **Not immediately descriptive**: Pair with clear tagline: "Qteria: Evidence-Based Document Validation" or "Qteria validates certification documents 400x faster"

**How to strengthen Qteria**:

1. **Clear tagline** - "Evidence-Based Document Validation" or "Quality Criteria. Fast Validation."
2. **Pronunciation guide** - Include in signature, website, presentations: "Qteria (kway-TEER-ee-uh)"
3. **Visual consistency** - Strong logo, consistent branding makes abstract names memorable
4. **Story/meaning** - Explain etymology: "Quality + Criteria = Qteria validates documents using quality-driven criteria"

**Next steps if chosen**:
1. ✅ **Keep using Qteria** (don't switch - brand equity is valuable)
2. **Confirm USPTO clearance** - File trademark application to protect name
3. **Secure additional domains** - .io, .ai, .eu (protect brand across TLDs)
4. **Reserve social handles** - LinkedIn, Twitter/X, YouTube (consistent brand presence)
5. **Create pronunciation guide** - Include in all materials, train team on consistent pronunciation
6. **Develop tagline** - Pair with clear descriptor to reduce explanation burden

---

### 🥈 Second Choice: **Veridox**

**Why this is a strong alternative** (if you're not committed to Qteria):

If you're genuinely reconsidering the name (not just validating Qteria), **Veridox** is the strongest alternative because it:

**1. Emphasizes Core Differentiator**
- **"Veri" (Veritas = truth/evidence)** directly aligns with transparency value (evidence-based validation, not black-box AI)
- Step 3 aha moment: "IT ACTUALLY WORKS" because AI shows **truth/proof** (page 8, section 3.2)
- Your #1 competitive advantage is evidence-based validation - Veridox communicates this

**2. Professional European Heritage**
- Latin root (Veritas) fits brand personality: authoritative, professional, European quality management tradition
- Stronger European sound than Qteria (Latin vs Q-abbreviation)
- Fits TÜV SÜD partnership (German quality, European standards)

**3. Clearer Pronunciation**
- "VER-ih-doks" - one clear pronunciation (vs Qteria's Q-teria? Kway-teria?)
- Easier to spell after hearing once (Veridox vs Qteria)
- Lower barrier to word-of-mouth adoption

**Considerations**:
- **Switching cost**: If you're already using Qteria, switching to Veridox means losing established brand equity (domain, recognition)
- **Similar to Veridocs**: ID authentication company exists (different space but similar name - check if confusing)
- **Less criteria connection**: Emphasizes truth/evidence but not validation criteria workflow (Qteria's strength)

**When to choose Veridox over Qteria**:
- If you're **early stage** and haven't built significant Qteria brand equity yet
- If **transparency/evidence** is more important messaging than **quality/criteria** (shift emphasis)
- If **pronunciation simplicity** is critical (easier for sales calls, conferences, word-of-mouth)

**Next steps if chosen**:
1. **Conduct USPTO search** - Confirm clearance (check against Veridocs, other "Veri" names)
2. **Secure veridox.com** - Check availability, purchase immediately if available
3. **Reserve social handles** - LinkedIn, Twitter/X, YouTube
4. **Develop messaging** - Emphasize "truth in documents" (Veritas = truth, transparency value)
5. **Create visual identity** - Professional European feel (quality management heritage)

### 🥉 Third Choice: **Certia**

**Why this is worth considering** (simplicity over uniqueness):

If **pronunciation simplicity** and **ease of adoption** are highest priorities (over uniqueness or established brand equity), **Certia** is worth considering because:

**1. Simplest Pronunciation and Spelling**
- "SER-tee-uh" - one clear pronunciation, no ambiguity
- Easy to spell after hearing once (no Q vs K confusion)
- Low barrier to word-of-mouth, sales calls, conference introductions

**2. Dual Meaning Connection**
- **"Certainty"** = confidence in validation results (brand promise: reliable, trustworthy)
- **"Criteria"** = validation criteria workflow (like Qteria but simpler)
- Combines emotional value (certainty) with functional value (criteria)

**3. Professional Sound**
- European professional feel (similar to Qteria but softer pronunciation)
- Fits brand personality: competent, authoritative, direct

**Considerations**:
- **Similar to "inertia"**: Could cause confusion or negative association (slowness vs 400x faster)
- **Less unique**: More common Latin root (may have more trademark conflicts than Qteria)
- **Switching cost**: If already using Qteria, is simplification worth losing established brand equity?
- **Less quality emphasis**: "Certainty" doesn't emphasize quality as much as Qteria's "Q"

**When to choose Certia**:
- If **ease of pronunciation** is make-or-break (critical for sales-led growth, conference presence)
- If you're **early stage** and pronunciation friction is hurting word-of-mouth
- If **certainty/confidence** resonates more than **quality** in customer conversations

**Next steps if chosen**:
1. **Conduct USPTO search** - Check for conflicts (more common root than Qteria)
2. **Check domain availability** - certia.com, certia.io (may be taken)
3. **Test pronunciation** - Say it in sales calls, see if people understand/remember it
4. **Develop messaging** - Emphasize "certainty in validation" (confidence, reliability)

8. **Social** - Are handles available (LinkedIn, Twitter/X, YouTube)?
