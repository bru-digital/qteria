## Brand Identity Overview

### Purpose

This visual identity system expresses **professional competence with approachable warmth** to **TIC notified bodies and certification professionals** through design. Every visual element communicates **transparency, quality, and domain expertise** while supporting the journey value: **evidence-based AI validation that saves time and prevents embarrassment**.

### Brand Personality (from Brand Strategy)

**Character**: The competent quality management professional in her early 30s - office nerd who loves details and precision. Balkan beauty. The person you want reviewing your documents because she catches everything and explains it clearly.

- **Personality Traits**: Professional, Direct, Trustworthy, Organized, Supportive
- **Core Values**: Quality Over Speed (but we deliver both), Transparency, Simplicity, Domain Expertise, Partnership
- **Visual Direction**: Clean, organized, trustworthy - modern but not trendy, professional but not cold, subtle warmth prevents generic enterprise feel
- **Target Audience**: Project Handlers (daily users running 15-20 assessments) and Process Managers (defining validation workflows) at TIC notified bodies

### Design Philosophy

**Clarity Through Structure**

Our visual identity balances professional credibility with approachable expertise. Like a well-organized office where everything has its place, the identity communicates competence through clean structure while subtle warmth (Balkan heritage) prevents it from feeling like generic enterprise software. Evidence-based validation requires evidence-based design - every visual choice serves clear communication, not decoration.

**Core Design Principle**: If it doesn't help users validate documents faster or trust results more, it doesn't belong in the identity.

## Logo Concepts

### Concept A: The Evidence Mark (Lettermark + Symbol)

**Type**: Combination Mark (Lettermark "Q" + Wordmark "teria")

**Description**:

The logo centers on a distinctive **"Q"** letterform that doubles as a **quality badge and magnifying lens**. The "Q" is constructed from two elements:
- **Circular outer ring** (clean, geometric, representing completeness/quality gate)
- **Checkmark-inspired tail** that transforms the Q's descender into a subtle validation symbol

The Q uses **primary blue** (#2563EB) with the checkmark tail in **terracotta** (#C2410C) as a warm accent. The wordmark "teria" appears in **Inter Semibold** in **gray-900** (#111827), maintaining clean readability while the Q provides visual distinction.

**Typography**:
- Q: Custom geometric construction (based on Inter structure but optimized as logomark)
- "teria": Inter Semibold, slightly tracked (2% letter spacing)
- Size relationship: Q is 1.4x the cap height of "teria"

**Color Application**:
- Primary version: Blue Q with terracotta accent + gray-900 wordmark
- Reversed version: White Q + white wordmark on dark backgrounds
- Single color: All blue-600 or all gray-900 depending on context
- Icon-only: Q lettermark with both colors

**Rationale**:
- **Expresses brand personality**: The Q as "quality badge" connects to quality management expertise. Geometric precision = competent professional. Terracotta accent = Balkan warmth without undermining authority.
- **Serves journey audience**: TIC professionals immediately recognize checkmark/validation symbol. "Q for Quality" is intuitive in certification industry. The magnifying lens metaphor connects to "evidence-based" validation (looking closely at documents).
- **Communicates journey value**: The checkmark integration says "validation" at a glance. The circular badge form suggests thoroughness and completeness - documents pass through a quality gate.
- **Differentiation**: Not a literal document icon or generic checkmark. The Q letterform is ownable. Terracotta accent differentiates from all-blue competitors while staying professional.

**Versatility**:
- **Minimum size**: 32px height for full logo (web), 0.6" for print
- **Icon-only works at**: 24px (favicon, app icon) - Q is recognizable alone
- **Works well**: App icons (Q alone), website headers (full combo), business cards (horizontal layout), email signatures (small but clear)
- **Challenges**: Terracotta accent disappears at very small sizes (16px favicon) - use single-color blue Q instead

**Strengths**:
- ✅ Versatile - Q works standalone or with wordmark
- ✅ Distinctive letterform is ownable and memorable
- ✅ Checkmark + quality badge metaphor immediate to TIC audience
- ✅ Warm accent differentiates without sacrificing professionalism

**Considerations**:
- Two-color logo requires more production (print costs slightly higher)
- Q custom form may need refinement for optical balance
- "Q for Quality" association is positive but not unique (many Q-name quality tools exist)

---

### Concept B: The Document Thread (Wordmark + Abstract Symbol)

**Type**: Combination Mark (Abstract Symbol + Wordmark)

**Description**:

An abstract symbol representing **a document passing through AI validation** appears left of the wordmark. The symbol consists of:
- Three horizontal lines (document/text lines) in **blue-500** (#3B82F6)
- A curved path threading through the lines in **terracotta** (#C2410C), representing AI reading/analyzing
- Checkmark termination on the thread (validation complete)

The overall form is contained, geometric, and reads left-to-right (document → analysis → validation). The wordmark "Qteria" uses **Inter Semibold** in **gray-900**, giving the symbol room to breathe.

**Typography**:
- Wordmark: Inter Semibold, sentence case (Qteria)
- Spacing: 1.5x the symbol width between symbol and wordmark
- Size relationship: Symbol height matches cap height of "Q"

**Color Application**:
- Primary: Blue lines + terracotta thread
- Reversed: White lines + light terracotta (or all white) on dark
- Single color: All blue-600
- Icon-only: Symbol alone (requires 32px+ to be clear)

**Rationale**:
- **Expresses brand personality**: Abstract but not ambiguous - the symbol tells a clear story (document processing). Geometric structure = organized professional. Curved thread = human touch in AI validation.
- **Serves journey audience**: Document lines are universal in TIC industry. The flow metaphor (document → validation → checkmark) matches their mental model of the workflow.
- **Communicates journey value**: The thread "reading" through document lines visualizes evidence-based validation (AI examines document content, not just binary check). Checkmark endpoint = confidence in results.
- **Differentiation**: Not a literal magnifying glass or document icon. Abstract enough to feel modern/tech, concrete enough to communicate category clearly.

**Versatility**:
- **Minimum size**: 40px height for full logo (detail in thread requires space)
- **Icon-only works at**: 48px+ (below that, thread detail gets lost)
- **Works well**: Website headers (horizontal space), presentations (clear storytelling), marketing materials (distinctive shape)
- **Challenges**: Too detailed for favicon (<24px). Must simplify to checkmark-only icon for small sizes.

**Strengths**:
- ✅ Tells a clear story: document → AI analysis → validation
- ✅ Abstract symbol is more unique than literal document icon
- ✅ Warm accent creates visual interest, guides eye through symbol
- ✅ Professional but not boring

**Considerations**:
- Requires larger minimum size to maintain detail
- Icon-only version less versatile (needs simplification for small sizes)
- Two-element symbol (lines + thread) more complex to reproduce than single letterform

---

### Concept C: The Quality Q (Pure Wordmark with Distinction)

**Type**: Wordmark (Text Only with Visual Distinction)

**Description**:

A typographic solution where **"Qteria"** is set in a customized version of **Inter**. The distinction comes from:
- The **"Q"** letterform uses **terracotta** (#C2410C) while rest of wordmark is **blue-600** (#2563EB)
- The Q's tail is extended and subtly curves upward (quality/confidence gesture)
- Optional: A minimal underline beneath "teria" in terracotta (connecting Q's color, grounding the wordmark)

The wordmark is clean, modern, and highly readable. Color split creates visual interest without requiring an icon.

**Typography**:
- Font: Inter Semibold, customized Q tail
- Size: Single size - all letters same height (no oversized Q)
- Tracking: Slight negative tracking (-1%) for cohesion
- Optional baseline: 1px terracotta line beneath "teria" (20% length of wordmark)

**Color Application**:
- Primary: Terracotta Q + Blue "teria"
- Reversed: White Q + White "teria" (or light terracotta Q for distinction on dark)
- Single color: All blue-600 or all gray-900
- Icon version: Stylized Q letterform alone

**Rationale**:
- **Expresses brand personality**: Direct and clear (no symbol needed to explain what we do - name is the brand). The color distinction adds warmth/personality without undermining professionalism. Confidence in name recognition (we don't hide behind symbol).
- **Serves journey audience**: Wordmarks are common in B2B software (Stripe, Linear, Notion model). Builds name recognition fast - every appearance reinforces "Qteria" brand, not just symbol recall.
- **Communicates journey value**: The upward-curving Q tail suggests positive outcomes, quality improvement, validation success. Terracotta Q stands out in sea of blue competitors (differentiation through color).
- **Differentiation**: Most competitors use icon + word. Pure wordmark with color distinction is cleaner, more confident. Memorable because unusual in compliance/validation category.

**Versatility**:
- **Minimum size**: 28px height (high legibility as pure text)
- **Icon-only**: Stylized Q letterform (works at 24px+)
- **Works well**: All contexts - headers, footprints, signatures. Scales better than complex symbols.
- **Challenges**: Requires strong brand name (Qteria works - distinctive, pronounceable). Less instantly "category signaling" than document/checkmark icon.

**Strengths**:
- ✅ Highly legible and scalable (wordmark inherently readable)
- ✅ Builds name recognition fastest (every logo appearance teaches the name)
- ✅ Confident and direct (matches brand personality)
- ✅ Color split creates interest without complexity
- ✅ Works in single color easily (all blue or all gray)

**Considerations**:
- Less literal category signaling (no document/checkmark icon)
- Requires audience to learn what "Qteria" means (not self-evident like "DocValidator")
- Q color distinction may be subtle at small sizes

---

### Concept D: The Certificate Badge (Pictorial Mark + Word)

**Type**: Combination Mark (Pictorial Icon + Wordmark)

**Description**:

A simplified **certificate/badge icon** with a centered **checkmark**, appearing left of the wordmark. The icon:
- **Outer badge shape**: Rounded square with subtle border, suggesting certification/quality seal
- **Inner checkmark**: Clean, geometric checkmark (not hand-drawn) in **terracotta** (#C2410C)
- **Badge background**: **blue-50** (#EFF6FF) with **blue-600** border, or solid **blue-500** with white checkmark (reversed)
- Wordmark "Qteria" in **Inter Semibold**, **gray-900**

**Typography**:
- Wordmark: Inter Semibold, clean and modern
- Spacing: 1.2x icon width between icon and wordmark
- Alignment: Icon and wordmark baseline-aligned

**Color Application**:
- Primary: Light blue badge + terracotta check + gray-900 wordmark
- Alternate: Solid blue badge + white check + gray-900 wordmark
- Reversed: White badge outline + terracotta check + white wordmark on dark
- Icon-only: Badge with checkmark (highly recognizable)

**Rationale**:
- **Expresses brand personality**: Badge/certificate form = quality management authority. Clean geometric execution = organized professional. Checkmark = validation confidence. Terracotta check adds warmth without undermining authority.
- **Serves journey audience**: TIC professionals work with certificates and validation daily - instant category recognition. Badge shape signals "approval" and "quality gate" - core to their workflow.
- **Communicates journey value**: Checkmark inside quality badge = "validated by quality expert." Direct visual communication of journey value (documents pass validation, receive quality seal).
- **Differentiation**: While checkmarks are common, the badge form makes it feel more authoritative (not just "task complete" but "quality certified"). Terracotta check differentiates from pure blue competitors.

**Versatility**:
- **Minimum size**: 32px for full logo (badge detail needs space)
- **Icon-only**: Badge with check works at 24px (great for favicons, app icons)
- **Works well**: App icons (badge form natural for iOS/Android), certificates/reports (meta - logo is itself a quality badge), email signatures
- **Challenges**: Very literal symbolism (less abstract/unique than other concepts). May feel "expected" rather than distinctive.

**Strengths**:
- ✅ Instant category recognition (certification/validation)
- ✅ Badge icon extremely versatile (square works well for app icons)
- ✅ Authoritative feel (quality seal = trusted approval)
- ✅ Checkmark universal for "validated/approved"

**Considerations**:
- May feel generic (many validation tools use checkmarks/badges)
- Less distinctive than custom letterform (Q concepts)
- Risk of looking like "generic enterprise compliance" rather than modern AI tool

---

### Concept E: The Insight Line (Minimalist Abstract)

**Type**: Combination Mark (Abstract Symbol + Wordmark)

**Description**:

A highly minimal abstract mark: **a single curved line transitioning to a checkmark**. The line:
- Starts as a smooth curve in **blue-500** (#3B82F6), representing flow/reading/analysis
- Transitions to **terracotta** (#C2410C) as it forms a checkmark angle
- Gradient transition point at the curve's inflection (blue → terracotta blend zone)
- Total form is contained, simple, one continuous line

Wordmark "Qteria" in **Inter Semibold**, **gray-900**, right of symbol.

**Typography**:
- Wordmark: Inter Semibold, clean sans-serif
- Spacing: 1.5x symbol width gap
- Alignment: Symbol center-aligned with wordmark x-height

**Color Application**:
- Primary: Blue-to-terracotta gradient in line
- Reversed: White line (or light blue to terracotta) on dark
- Single color: All blue-600 (no gradient)
- Icon-only: Symbol alone (minimal but requires 32px+ for gradient clarity)

**Rationale**:
- **Expresses brand personality**: Minimal and modern = efficiency and clarity (no clutter). Continuous line = smooth process, flow. Transition to checkmark = AI analysis leads to validation. Gradient shows transformation (document input → validated output).
- **Serves journey audience**: Appeals to Process Managers who value elegance and efficiency. Less literal than document icons - suggests sophistication. Checkmark endpoint grounds the abstraction (still communicates "validation").
- **Communicates journey value**: The line's journey = user's journey (input → processing → validated result). Blue (AI/tech) transitioning to terracotta (warm/confident outcome) visualizes transformation from uncertainty to trust.
- **Differentiation**: Most minimal of all concepts - stands out through restraint. Gradient is unique (most logos use flat color). Modern aesthetic differentiates from traditional compliance tools.

**Versatility**:
- **Minimum size**: 36px for gradient version (gradient needs space), 28px for flat single-color
- **Icon-only**: Works at 32px+ (gradient version), 24px+ (single color)
- **Works well**: Digital contexts (web, app, screen) where gradients render well. Modern pitch decks, presentations.
- **Challenges**: Gradient complicates print production (requires more colors). Very abstract - may not communicate category clearly to first-time viewers. Small sizes lose gradient subtlety.

**Strengths**:
- ✅ Most modern/sophisticated aesthetic
- ✅ Highly distinctive (gradient curve-to-check unique)
- ✅ Minimal form = very flexible in layouts
- ✅ Tells transformation story (input → validated output)

**Considerations**:
- Gradient increases production complexity (print, embroidery, single-color contexts)
- Most abstract - may require more brand education (what does line mean?)
- Icon-only version less immediately recognizable than Q letterform or badge
- Gradient trends can date (flat color fallback needed for longevity)

## Recommended Logo: Concept A - The Evidence Mark

**Why this concept wins**:

✅ **Best expresses brand personality**: The Q as quality badge + magnifying lens perfectly embodies "competent professional who catches everything." Geometric precision = organized expertise. Checkmark tail integration = direct communication (we validate). Terracotta accent = Balkan warmth differentiating from cold enterprise tools.

✅ **Most appealing to journey audience**: TIC professionals immediately recognize quality/validation symbolism (badge + checkmark). The "Q" is distinctive and memorable - builds brand equity through unique letterform. Process Managers and Project Handlers both connect with clarity (no abstract interpretation needed).

✅ **Versatile across all touchpoints**: The Q letterform works standalone (favicons, app icons at 24px+) or with full wordmark (headers, business cards). Scales from 16px single-color favicon to billboard. Horizontal layout for headers, stacked for square formats.

✅ **Distinctive from competitors**: Not a generic document icon or floating checkmark. The Q letterform is ownable IP. Terracotta accent breaks the "all blue" compliance tool pattern while maintaining professionalism. "Q for Quality" is intuitive but executed uniquely.

✅ **Timeless design**: Geometric letterform won't feel dated (unlike gradient trends or complex illustrations). Can evolve over time (refine proportions) without losing recognition. The circular badge form is classic quality management visual language.

✅ **Scalable from favicon to billboard**:
- 16px: Single-color blue Q (minimal)
- 24px+: Two-color Q with terracotta accent
- 32px+: Full Q + "teria" wordmark
- Large formats: All detail visible, badge form impactful

**Journey-Brand Alignment**:

- **Communicates "evidence-based validation" visually**: The Q as magnifying lens = looking closely at documents for evidence. The checkmark tail = validation result. The circular badge = quality gate (documents must pass through).

- **Appeals to Project Handlers' emotional state**: When they face quality anxiety (errors slipping through to Certification Person), the quality badge logo communicates authority and thoroughness. "This tool catches what I might miss."

- **Reinforces brand promise**: "Clear, accurate, respectful of expertise" = The logo is clear (simple Q form), accurate (quality badge = precise validation), respectful (professional execution, not playful or condescending).

**Implementation recommendation**: Start with **Concept A** and create logo files immediately. This identity can launch with MVP. If user testing reveals strong feedback for different direction, revisit Concept C (wordmark simplicity) or Concept B (document thread storytelling) in future.

  - Favicon (browser tab): 16px - use simplified single-color Q
- **Print**:
  - Full logo: 0.6 inches height minimum
  - Icon-only: 0.4 inches minimum
- **Below minimum**: Use icon-only Q in single color (blue or gray)

### Logo Variations

**Horizontal Layout** (Primary):
```
[Q]  Qteria
← gap: 0.8x Q width →
```
- **Aspect ratio**: Approximately 3.5:1 (width:height)
- **Use**: Website headers, email signatures, letterhead, most digital applications
- **Spacing**: Q and wordmark baseline-aligned

**Stacked/Vertical Layout**:
```
    [Q]
  Qteria
```
- **Aspect ratio**: Approximately 1:1.4 (width:height)
- **Use**: Social media avatars (when square is required), mobile app loading screens, tight vertical spaces
- **Spacing**: Gap between Q and wordmark = 0.4x Q height
- **Alignment**: Q and wordmark center-aligned

**Icon Only** (Q Letterform):
```
[Q]
```
- **Use**:
  - Favicon (browser tab icon): 16px, single-color blue
  - App icon (iOS/Android): 1024x1024px, full-color with background
  - Social media profile picture (when "Qteria" appears in username/handle)
  - Loading spinners (Q can rotate as progress indicator)
- **Works at**: 24px+ for two-color version, 16px+ for single-color
- **⚠️ Caution**: Only use when brand has established recognition OR when "Qteria" name appears nearby in text

**Simplified Version** (Extreme Small Sizes):
```
[Q] ← simplified: thicker ring, no tail detail
```
- **Use**: When below 16px (rare - perhaps smartwatch icons, extreme low-res contexts)
- **Modification**: Increase ring thickness 20%, simplify checkmark tail to straight diagonal
- **Works at**: 12px-16px (absolute minimum)

### Logo Clearspace

**Clearspace Rule**: Maintain clearspace equal to **0.5x the height of the Q** on all sides of the logo.

```
        ↕ 0.5Q
    ←→ 0.5Q
    ┌─────────────────┐
    │                 │
    │   [Q] Qteria   │
    │                 │
    └─────────────────┘
        ↕ 0.5Q
```

**Minimum Clearspace**:
- **Top**: 0.5x Q height
- **Right**: 0.5x Q height
- **Bottom**: 0.5x Q height
- **Left**: 0.5x Q height

**Why**: Clearspace ensures the logo has breathing room and isn't crowded by other UI elements, text, or competing visuals. This maintains visibility, impact, and professional presentation.

**Exception**: In navigation bars or space-constrained UI, clearspace can reduce to 0.3x Q height, but never less.

## Color Palette Application

### Primary Brand Color

**Trust Blue** (Primary):
- **HEX**: #2563EB (blue-600 from design system)
- **RGB**: rgb(37, 99, 235)
- **CMYK**: C:84 M:58 Y:0 K:8
- **Pantone**: PMS 2728 C (closest match)

**Usage**:
- Q letterform outer ring (logo)
- Primary CTAs ("Start Assessment", "Save Workflow")
- Interactive elements (links, selected states, active tabs)
- Progress indicators (loading bars, spinners)
- Focus states (form inputs, keyboard navigation)

**Psychology/Meaning**: Blue conveys trust, professionalism, and reliability - essential in TIC/compliance industry where accuracy is non-negotiable. Blue-600 is saturated enough for energy (not passive gray-blue) but not bright enough to feel playful. This is "quality management blue" - serious and competent.

**Accessibility**:
- White text on blue-600: 5.2:1 contrast (WCAG AA pass)
- Blue-600 on white: Use for links and interactive elements (3:1 contrast with surrounding gray-900 text)

---

### Secondary Brand Color (Warm Accent)

**Balkan Terracotta** (Warm Accent):
- **HEX**: #C2410C (terracotta-500 from design system)
- **RGB**: rgb(194, 65, 12)
- **CMYK**: C:0 M:67 Y:94 K:24
- **Pantone**: PMS 7516 C (closest match)

**Usage**:
- Q letterform checkmark tail (logo)
- **Sparingly** in UI: Warm callouts, special highlights (1-2 places per page maximum)
- Hover states on secondary actions (not primary CTAs - those stay blue)
- Brand accents in marketing materials (section dividers, pull quotes)
- **NOT for**: Error states (use semantic red), success states (use semantic green), primary CTAs (use blue)

**Psychology/Meaning**: Warm earth tone adds personality and differentiation. References Balkan heritage (warm, grounded, human touch). Prevents brand from feeling like generic cold enterprise software. The warmth says "we're experts, but approachable."

**Accessibility**:
- White text on terracotta-500: 4.6:1 contrast (WCAG AA pass for large text, borderline for body text)
- Use terracotta for accents and large elements (badges, icons, section headers), not body text

---

### Neutral Grays (Structure & Hierarchy)

**Light Neutrals** (Backgrounds, surfaces):
- **Gray-50** (#F9FAFB): Page backgrounds
- **Gray-100** (#F3F4F6): Card backgrounds, alternate row shading
- **Gray-200** (#E5E7EB): Borders, dividers, disabled input backgrounds

**Medium Neutrals** (Secondary text, labels):
- **Gray-300** (#D1D5DB): Disabled states, placeholder text
- **Gray-600** (#4B5563): Secondary text (helper text, metadata, labels)
- **Gray-700** (#374151): Form labels, secondary navigation

**Dark Neutrals** (Primary text, emphasis):
- **Gray-900** (#111827): Primary text, headings, wordmark in logo

**Usage**:
- Grays form 90% of UI - text, borders, backgrounds, structure
- Use blue and terracotta as accents only (5-10% of UI color)
- Gray-900 on white: 16.6:1 contrast (excellent readability)
- Gray-600 on white: 7.4:1 contrast (WCAG AAA pass)

---

### Semantic Colors (Status & Feedback)

**Success Green** (Validation passed, criteria met):
- **HEX**: #22C55E (green-500)
- **RGB**: rgb(34, 197, 94)
- **Usage**:
  - Criteria status badge ("PASS" label background green-50, text green-700)
  - Checkmark icons (✓) for passed criteria
  - Success toast notifications
  - Progress completion states

**Warning Yellow** (Uncertain AI result, needs review):
- **HEX**: #EAB308 (yellow-500)
- **RGB**: rgb(234, 179, 8)
- **Usage**:
  - Criteria status badge ("UNCERTAIN" label background yellow-50, text yellow-700)
  - Warning icons (⚠) for ambiguous results
  - Caution alerts ("AI confidence is low - manual review recommended")

**Error Red** (Validation failed, critical issue):
- **HEX**: #EF4444 (red-500)
- **RGB**: rgb(239, 68, 68)
- **Usage**:
  - Criteria status badge ("FAIL" label background red-50, text red-700)
  - X mark icons (✗) for failed criteria
  - Error messages, form validation errors
  - Destructive action confirmations ("Delete Workflow")

**Rationale**: Standard traffic light pattern (green/yellow/red) is universally understood for pass/uncertain/fail. Maintains consistency with design system. Semantic colors are always paired with icons (✓ ⚠ ✗) to ensure accessibility (never color-only communication).

---

### Color Combinations

**Approved Color Pairings**:

1. **Primary Brand (Most Common)**:
   - Blue-600 + Gray-900 + White backgrounds
   - Use: 90% of applications (website, app UI, documents)
   - Example: Blue CTAs, gray-900 headings, white cards

2. **Warm Accent (Selective Use)**:
   - Terracotta-500 + Blue-600 + White
   - Use: Logo, special callouts (1-2 per page), marketing accents
   - Example: Q logo with terracotta tail, section divider with warm accent

3. **Semantic Status (Results Display)**:
   - Green-500 + Yellow-500 + Red-500 (with gray-50 backgrounds)
   - Use: Criteria results cards, status badges, validation feedback
   - Example: Green "PASS" badge, red "FAIL" badge, yellow "UNCERTAIN" badge

4. **Dark Mode (Reversed)**:
   - White + Blue-400 (lighter blue for dark backgrounds) + Gray-900 background
   - Use: Dark website sections, dark mode app UI (future), video overlays
   - Example: White text, blue-400 links, gray-900 background

**Avoid**:
- ❌ **Terracotta + Red**: Too similar, confusing (warm accent vs. error state)
- ❌ **Blue + Green + Yellow + Red all at once**: Too much color competition, overwhelming
- ❌ **More than 3 colors in single composition**: Cluttered, violates simplicity principle
- ❌ **Terracotta as primary CTA color**: Reserve blue for primary actions (consistency)

**Color Usage Ratios** (Ideal Balance):
- **70%**: Neutral grays (backgrounds, text, structure)
- **20%**: Primary blue (CTAs, links, interactive elements)
- **5%**: Semantic colors (status badges, alerts)
- **5%**: Terracotta warm accent (logo, special highlights)

## Typography System

### Primary Brand Font (Headlines, Logo, UI)

**Font**: **Inter** (Variable font, weights 400-700)

- **Weights available**:
  - 400 Regular (body text, form inputs)
  - 500 Medium (labels, navigation, secondary buttons)
  - 600 Semibold (headings, primary buttons, logo wordmark)
  - 700 Bold (rare - strong emphasis, "FAIL" labels)

- **Fallback Stack**: `'Inter', -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif`

**Usage**:
- **Logo wordmark** ("teria"): Inter Semibold 600
- **Page headlines** (H1, H2): Inter Semibold 600
- **Body text**: Inter Regular 400
- **UI elements**: Inter Medium 500 for labels/buttons, Regular 400 for inputs/content
- **All applications**: Web, app, marketing, documents

**Why Inter**:
- **High legibility at small sizes**: Evidence text ("page 8, section 3.2") must be readable. Inter excels at 14px and below.
- **Professional without being corporate-stiff**: Matches "competent office professional" personality - modern, clean, approachable.
- **Excellent number legibility**: Important for page references, criteria counts, assessment numbers. Tabular figures available.
- **Variable font efficiency**: Single file for weights 400-700 reduces load time (critical for Step 3 results page with many criteria).
- **Industry standard for B2B tools**: Stripe, Linear, GitHub, Vercel use Inter - signals quality and modernity to TIC professionals.

**Character**: Modern, clean, neutral yet warm. The slightly rounded terminals soften the geometric structure, preventing cold/robotic feel. Highly functional (designed for UI readability) but with subtle personality.

**Web Performance**:
- Use variable font (Inter-Variable.woff2): 100KB for all weights vs. 50KB × 4 weights = 200KB
- Self-host via Google Fonts or Vercel's @next/font (optimized loading)
- Load weights 400, 500, 600 only (skip 700 unless needed)

---

### Monospace Font (Technical Details)

**Font**: **JetBrains Mono** (for document references, technical data)

- **Weights available**: 400 Regular, 500 Medium
- **Fallback Stack**: `'JetBrains Mono', 'Courier New', Courier, monospace`

**Usage**:
- Document file paths: `/uploads/technical-documentation.pdf`
- Page references: `page 8, section 3.2` (evidence links)
- API responses (if shown in debug/developer mode)
- Code snippets (documentation, developer docs)

**Why JetBrains Mono**:
- **High legibility for technical text**: Designed for code, optimized for long reading of technical content
- **Clear distinction between similar characters**: 0 (zero) vs O (letter), 1 (one) vs l (lowercase L) vs I (capital i)
- **Matches Inter's modern aesthetic**: Both are contemporary, functional fonts
- **Pairs well without competing**: Monospace clearly signals "technical detail" vs. Inter's general content

**Character**: Technical, precise, functional. The ligatures (optional) add subtle sophistication without sacrificing clarity.

---

### Font Pairing Rationale

**Inter + JetBrains Mono** work together because:
- **Both are modern, functional fonts** designed for screen readability
- **Clear role distinction**: Inter = general content, JetBrains Mono = technical precision
- **Visual harmony**: Both have clean geometric structure, neither overpowers
- **User journey fit**: Most UI is Inter (workflows, forms, navigation). Evidence links are monospace (signals "exact technical reference - click to verify").

**NOT using serif fonts** because:
- Serif = traditional, academic, editorial authority
- Sans-serif = modern, efficient, digital-native
- Journey audience (TIC professionals) expects modern B2B tool, not academic paper

---

### Typographic Scale

**Desktop** (Tailwind CSS scale, base 16px):

| Element | Size | Weight | Use Case |
|---------|------|--------|----------|
| **3xl** | 39px (2.441rem) | 600 Semibold | Hero headings (marketing site only) |
| **2xl** | 31px (1.953rem) | 600 Semibold | Page titles, dashboard headings |
| **xl** | 25px (1.563rem) | 600 Semibold | Page section headings ("Validation Results", "My Workflows") |
| **lg** | 20px (1.25rem) | 600 Semibold | Card titles, section subheadings |
| **base** | 16px (1rem) | 400 Regular | Body text, form inputs, default UI, criteria descriptions |
| **sm** | 14px (0.875rem) | 400 Regular | Secondary text, labels, small buttons, helper text |
| **xs** | 13px (0.8125rem) | 400 Regular | Captions, metadata ("Uploaded 2 min ago") |
| **2xs** | 12px (0.75rem) | 500 Medium | Micro labels, badges, timestamps |

**Mobile** (below 768px):
- Increase base to 17px for better mobile readability
- Scale headings down 1 step (2xl → xl, xl → lg, lg → base)
- Maintain sm/xs sizes (UI labels, buttons don't need to scale up)

**Journey Step Type Usage**:

**Step 1** (Workflow Creation):
- Form section headings: **xl** (25px) - "Define Criteria"
- Form labels: **sm** (14px) - "Workflow Name:"
- Input text: **base** (16px) - User-entered content
- Helper text: **xs** (13px) - "Choose a descriptive name..."

**Step 2** (Document Upload):
- Drag-drop instruction: **lg** (20px) - "Drag and drop documents here"
- File names: **base** (16px) - "technical-documentation.pdf"
- File metadata: **sm** (14px) - "3.2 MB • Uploaded 2 min ago"

**Step 3** (Progress Indicator):
- Status text: **base** (16px) - "Analyzing documents..."
- Progress percentage: **lg** (20px) - "45% complete"
- Time estimate: **sm** (14px) - "~3 minutes remaining"

**Step 4** (Results Display):
- Criteria name: **base** (16px) - "Criteria 1: All documents must be signed"
- Pass/Fail status: **lg** (20px) with icon - "PASS" / "FAIL"
- Evidence link: **sm** (14px) monospace - "test-report.pdf, page 8, section 3.2"
- AI reasoning: **sm** (14px) - Explanation paragraph

### Typography Guidelines

**Line Height**:
- **Tight** (1.25): Headings, navigation, buttons - where vertical space is limited
- **Normal** (1.5): Body text, forms, UI copy - balance readability and density
- **Relaxed** (1.75): Long-form content (help articles, documentation) - easier sustained reading

**Letter Spacing (Tracking)**:
- **Default** (0): Body text, forms, most UI
- **Slight tracking** (+2%, 0.02em): Logo wordmark "teria", all-caps labels (improves legibility)
- **Negative tracking** (-1%, -0.01em): Large headings (2xl, 3xl) to prevent loose appearance

**Paragraph Spacing**:
- Between paragraphs: 1.5em (24px at base 16px)
- Between sections: 2.5em (40px)

**Max Line Length**:
- Ideal: 65-75 characters per line for body text (optimal readability)
- Implementation: `max-w-2xl` (672px) for content blocks at base 16px

**Text Color**:
- Primary text: Gray-900 (#111827) - 16.6:1 contrast on white (excellent)
- Secondary text: Gray-600 (#4B5563) - 7.4:1 contrast (WCAG AAA pass)
- Disabled text: Gray-400 (#9CA3AF) - 4.5:1 contrast (WCAG AA pass for large text)
- Inverted: White on blue-600 (5.2:1 contrast), white on gray-900 (18:1 contrast)

---

## Visual Elements

### Patterns (Minimal Use)

**Dot Grid** (Subtle background pattern):
- **Description**: Very subtle 24px × 24px dot grid in gray-200 (#E5E7EB) on gray-50 (#F9FAFB) background
- **Opacity**: 30% (barely visible, adds texture without noise)
- **Usage**:
  - Marketing page hero sections (adds depth without distraction)
  - Empty states (break up large white spaces)
  - **NOT in app UI** (keep product interface clean, pattern-free)
- **Connection to brand**: Organized, structured (grid = quality management systems), minimal (doesn't compete with content)

**Avoid**: Complex patterns, gradients, textures that compete with content. Brand values simplicity - patterns should be felt, not seen.

---

### Iconography Style

**Style**: **Line icons** (stroke-based, not filled)

- **Library**: **Lucide React** (open-source, 1000+ icons, tree-shakeable)
- **Weight**: 2px stroke
- **Corners**: Rounded (matches Inter's subtle roundness)
- **Complexity**: Minimal detail - icons must be recognizable at 16px

**Rationale**: Line icons maintain clean, modern aesthetic. Stroke-based icons scale better than filled (detail visible at small sizes). Lucide's consistent 24px grid ensures visual harmony across icon set.

**Icon Usage Examples**:
- **Upload**: Cloud with up arrow (document upload zones)
- **Check**: Checkmark (PASS status)
- **X**: X mark (FAIL status)
- **AlertTriangle**: Triangle with ! (UNCERTAIN status, warnings)
- **FileText**: Document icon (file lists, workflow buckets)
- **Search**: Magnifying glass (search/filter inputs)
- **Settings**: Gear icon (workflow configuration)
- **User**: Avatar icon (user profile, settings)
- **ChevronDown**: Down arrow (expandable cards, dropdowns)
- **ExternalLink**: Arrow out of box (evidence links to documents)

**Icon Colors**:
- Default: Gray-400 (#9CA3AF) - neutral, doesn't compete with content
- Active/hover: Blue-600 (#2563EB) - interactive states
- Semantic: Green-500 (✓), Red-500 (✗), Yellow-500 (⚠) - status icons
- Size: 16px (inline with text), 20px (buttons, cards), 24px (section headers)

---

### Photography Style

**Aesthetic**: **Bright, Professional, Authentic**

**Guidelines**:

**Do**:
- ✅ **Feature real TIC professionals** in authentic work environments (notified body offices, certification labs, quality management settings)
- ✅ **Bright, well-lit images**: Natural light or soft artificial lighting. Avoid dark/moody photography.
- ✅ **Focus on documents, workflows, collaboration**: People reviewing documents, using software, working together. Show the work, not just posed portraits.
- ✅ **Diverse representation**: Age, gender, ethnicity - TIC industry is global, visuals should reflect that
- ✅ **Composition**: Clean, organized environments. Clutter-free desks, well-organized offices (matches brand value of organization/clarity).
- ✅ **Color treatment**: Natural, true-to-life colors. Can desaturate slightly (10-20%) for professional feel, but not extreme.

**Don't**:
- ❌ **Cheesy stock photos**: Forced smiles, overly posed, generic "business people shaking hands" clichés
- ❌ **Dramatic/moody lighting**: Too dark, high contrast shadows. Brand is bright/clear, not mysterious.
- ❌ **Consumer/lifestyle focus**: Brand is B2B professional tool, not lifestyle product. Avoid coffee shops, casual settings.
- ❌ **Empty sterile offices**: Avoid cold corporate photography (all-white rooms, no personality). Add subtle warmth.

**Example Scenarios**:
- Quality manager reviewing certification document at organized desk
- Team collaborating on document validation workflow (laptop screen visible with Qteria UI)
- Professional in sweater (matches brand character) focused on document review
- Notified body office environment (clean, professional, but lived-in)

**Color Grading**: Slight desaturation (10-15%), warm white balance (matches terracotta accent), high clarity (shows detail/precision).

**Usage**: Marketing website hero sections, case studies, about page. **NOT in app UI** (product stays minimal, photography reserved for marketing/brand storytelling).

---

### Illustration Style (Optional - Future Use)

**Style**: **Line illustrations** (matches icon style, but more detailed)

- **Aesthetic**: Simple line drawings in 2-3 colors (blue, terracotta, gray)
- **Detail level**: Moderate - more detail than icons, but not realistic/complex
- **Use cases**:
  - Empty states ("No workflows yet" - illustration of document with Q badge)
  - Onboarding screens (illustrate key concepts: workflow creation, document upload, AI validation)
  - Error states (friendly 404 page, connection errors)

**Why NOT using illustrations in MVP**:
- Resource constraint: Illustrations require design time/budget
- Brand leans professional, not playful - illustrations can feel "consumer-y"
- May add later if user testing shows concepts need visual explanation

**If implementing later**: Use Balkan illustrator (supports brand heritage), ensure illustrations match line icon aesthetic (consistent stroke weight, rounded corners, minimal detail).

---

### Graphic Elements

**Shapes**:
- **Rounded corners**: 6px radius (matches button border-radius from design system)
- **Cards**: Subtle shadow (shadow-sm), white background, 1px gray-200 border
- **No decorative shapes**: Brand values clarity - no floating geometric shapes, no abstract blobs

**Lines**:
- **Dividers**: 1px gray-200, subtle separation between sections
- **Thickness**: 1px default, 2px for emphasis (active tab underline)
- **Style**: Solid, not dashed/dotted (matches direct, clear personality)

**Shadows**:
- **Soft shadows only**: `shadow-sm` (default cards), `shadow-md` (hover states), `shadow-lg` (modals/popovers)
- **Never harsh shadows**: No heavy drop shadows, no black shadows (use gray with opacity)
- **Purpose**: Create depth/hierarchy, not decoration

**Spacing**:
- **Grid system**: 4px base unit (Tailwind default)
- **Common spacing**: 8px (compact), 16px (comfortable), 24px (generous), 32px (spacious)
- **Consistent rhythm**: Use 4px multiples for all margins, padding, gaps

**Rationale**: Minimal graphic elements keep focus on content (evidence-based validation results). Subtle shadows and rounded corners add warmth without undermining professionalism.

---

## Usage Guidelines

### Clearspace & Placement

**Clearspace**:
- Minimum space around logo = **0.5x the height of the Q** on all sides
- In space-constrained UI (navigation bars), can reduce to **0.3x Q height** minimum
- Never less than 0.3x - logo needs breathing room

**Placement**:
- **Website header**: Top left, standard web convention (users expect logo here)
- **App navigation**: Top left corner, 40px height logo, 16px padding around
- **Marketing materials**: Top center (presentations) or top left (documents)
- **Business cards**: Top left (front), small bottom right (back)
- **Email signature**: Left-aligned, 100px height max

**Alignment**:
- **Horizontal logo**: Baseline-align with adjacent text/UI elements
- **Stacked logo**: Center-align vertically and horizontally in square containers
- **Never rotate or angle**: Logo always upright (exception: vertical signage if needed)

---

### Approved Backgrounds

**Logo works well on**:

✅ **White or light backgrounds**:
- White (#FFFFFF)
- Gray-50 (#F9FAFB)
- Blue-50 (#EFF6FF)
- Any light background with sufficient contrast (test: Q must have 3:1 contrast minimum)

✅ **Brand color backgrounds** (using reversed logo):
- Blue-900 (#1E3A8A) - use white logo with light terracotta accent
- Gray-900 (#111827) - use white logo
- Blue-600 (#2563EB) - use white logo (rare - prefer white/light backgrounds)

✅ **Photography with sufficient contrast**:
- Light backgrounds (sky, white walls, bright environments)
- Use subtle dark overlay (20-40% opacity black) if photo is complex
- Test contrast: Q shape must be clearly visible against photo

✅ **Subtle patterns**:
- Dot grid (30% opacity) on gray-50 is approved
- Pattern must not compete with logo (logo always wins in visual hierarchy)

**Avoid**:

❌ **Busy backgrounds where logo gets lost**:
- Complex photographs without overlay
- Patterns with similar colors to logo (blue/terracotta patterns clash)
- Gradients that change contrast across logo width

❌ **Colors that reduce contrast below 3:1**:
- Medium gray backgrounds (gray-400/500) - neither dark enough for reversed nor light enough for color logo
- Colored backgrounds (green, yellow, red) unless part of semantic status display

❌ **Gradients that interfere with logo readability**:
- Gradients that transition from light to dark across logo width
- Multiple color gradients (blue to green to yellow) - too much competition

---

### Incorrect Logo Usage

**❌ DON'T**:

1. **Stretch or distort**:
   - Always maintain aspect ratio (width:height proportion)
   - If resizing, hold Shift (design software) or set only height OR width (CSS), not both
   - Wrong: Making logo wider to fit header without maintaining height ratio

2. **Change colors**:
   - Only use approved color versions (full color, single color blue/gray, reversed white)
   - Wrong: Making Q green, using pink accent instead of terracotta, changing wordmark to purple
   - Exception: Single-color versions in blue-600 or gray-900 are approved

3. **Add effects**:
   - No drop shadows (logo has no shadow in original design)
   - No glows, outer glows, inner shadows
   - No bevels, emboss, 3D effects
   - No gradients overlaid on logo (unless specified in approved versions)
   - Wrong: Adding Photoshop layer styles to "enhance" logo

4. **Rotate or angle**:
   - Logo should always be upright (0° rotation)
   - Wrong: Tilting logo 15° for "dynamic" feel, rotating as decoration
   - Exception: Vertical signage (90° rotation) if absolutely necessary

5. **Outline or stroke**:
   - Don't add strokes/outlines around logo elements
   - Wrong: Adding 2px black outline to Q, adding stroke to wordmark
   - If visibility is issue, use logo version designed for that background (reversed, overlay)

6. **Rearrange elements**:
   - Don't separate Q from "teria" wordmark (except when using icon-only version)
   - Don't change spacing between Q and wordmark
   - Don't stack when horizontal is specified, or vice versa
   - Wrong: Moving wordmark above Q, increasing gap between elements

7. **Place on poor contrast**:
   - Must meet WCAG AA standards (3:1 minimum for graphics)
   - Test: Q shape must be clearly visible at full logo size
   - Wrong: Blue Q on blue background, gray wordmark on gray background
   - Fix: Use reversed logo, add overlay, choose different background

8. **Use low resolution**:
   - Always use vector (SVG) when possible (web, apps, digital)
   - For print: 300 DPI minimum (PDF or high-res PNG)
   - Wrong: Using 72px PNG on billboard, using JPG with artifacts
   - Fix: Request proper file format from brand assets

9. **Combine with other logos improperly**:
   - Maintain clearspace between Qteria logo and partner logos
   - Don't merge logos (Qteria + Partner in single lockup)
   - Wrong: Overlapping logos, no spacing between
   - Fix: Use proper spacing (at least 0.5x Q height between logos)

10. **Use outdated versions**:
    - Always use current logo version (1.0 as of Nov 2025)
    - Wrong: Using old logo after rebrand/update
    - Fix: Download latest logo files from brand asset repository

---

### Accessibility Requirements

**Color Contrast** (WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance):

✅ **Logo on background**:
- Minimum 3:1 contrast ratio (WCAG AA for graphics/UI components)
- Q shape must be clearly distinguishable from background
- Test tool: WebAIM Contrast Checker, Chrome DevTools

✅ **Text on brand colors**:
- **White on Blue-600**: 5.2:1 (passes AA for body text, AAA for large text)
- **Gray-900 on White**: 16.6:1 (passes AAA for all text sizes)
- **Gray-600 on White**: 7.4:1 (passes AAA for body text)
- **White on Terracotta-500**: 4.6:1 (passes AA for large text 18px+, borderline for body)

✅ **Interactive elements**:
- Minimum 3:1 contrast against adjacent colors (buttons vs background)
- Focus indicators: 2px blue-600 outline with 2px offset (clearly visible)

**Non-Color Communication**:
- Never rely on color alone (always pair with icons/text)
- ✓ PASS badge: Green background + green text + checkmark icon
- ✗ FAIL badge: Red background + red text + X icon
- ⚠ UNCERTAIN badge: Yellow background + yellow text + warning icon

**Testing Process**:
1. Use WebAIM Contrast Checker (https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)
2. Test logo on all approved backgrounds (white, gray-50, blue-900, etc.)
3. Test text on all brand color backgrounds
4. Verify focus indicators visible on all backgrounds
5. Test with color blindness simulators (Stark plugin, Chrome DevTools)

### Packaging (If Applicable - Future)

**Not applicable for MVP** (SaaS product, no physical packaging).

**Future consideration**: If creating swag (t-shirts, mugs, stickers, notebooks):
- Logo: Icon-only Q works well for small items (stickers, mugs)
- Horizontal logo: T-shirts (front left chest, small), notebooks (cover center, large)
- Colors: Prioritize full-color version, fallback to single-color blue or white reversed
- Merchandise should feel professional (not playful) - quality materials match brand values

---

## What We DIDN'T Choose (And Why)

### Logo Type Decisions

**Pure Abstract Symbol (Not Chosen)**:
- **Why not**: Brand is new (launched 2025) and needs name recognition. Abstract symbols like Nike swoosh or Pepsi globe require years of marketing investment to build meaning. TIC professionals need to learn "Qteria" name immediately - can't rely on symbol-only recognition yet.
- **When to reconsider**: After 3-5 years of strong brand presence, if "Qteria" becomes widely known in TIC industry and we want to simplify to iconic Q mark (similar to how Nike evolved from "Nike" wordmark to swoosh-only).
- **Trade-off**: Abstract symbols become powerfully memorable once established (instant recognition without reading text), but risky for new brands (no inherent meaning, requires education).

**Concept selected instead**: Lettermark Q + wordmark combination gives us both (distinctive Q builds visual equity, wordmark teaches name).

---

**Complex Illustration/Pictorial Mark (Not Chosen)**:
- **Why not**: Brand values clarity over decoration. Complex illustrations (hand-drawn document, elaborate checkmark designs) don't scale well to small sizes (favicon at 16px becomes blob). Target audience (TIC professionals) expects professional restraint, not artistic flourish. Detailed illustrations can feel consumer-product or playful, undermining authority.
- **When to reconsider**: If brand pivots to consumer-facing education about certification (general public, not B2B professionals) where friendliness/approachability matters more than authority. Or if launching sub-brand targeting different audience.
- **Trade-off**: Detailed illustrations can be charming and highly distinctive (Mailchimp's mascot) but limit versatility (don't work at small sizes, harder to reproduce across materials, can feel dated quickly).

**Concept selected instead**: Clean geometric Q letterform (scales perfectly, timeless, professional).

---

**Trendy Geometric Overlap Style (Not Chosen)**:
- **Why not**: Geometric overlapping shapes (like layered rectangles forming abstract mark) were trendy 2015-2020 but now feel dated. Brand strategy emphasizes timeless design - we prioritize longevity over trendiness. Also, overlap style doesn't communicate anything specific about document validation (pure abstraction without meaning connection).
- **When to reconsider**: If competitive analysis shows ALL competitors using traditional/conservative marks and we need maximum visual disruption to stand out. Or if targeting younger/startup TIC companies who value modern aesthetic over traditional authority.
- **Trade-off**: Trendy designs get immediate attention ("that looks fresh!") but age poorly (dated within 3-5 years). Timeless designs feel "right" longer but may be less exciting initially.

**Concept selected instead**: Geometric Q, but with meaningful connection (quality badge + checkmark) not pure abstraction.

---

**Literal Document + Magnifying Glass (Not Chosen)**:
- **Why not**: Too on-the-nose. Literal document icon with magnifying glass screams "document review tool" but isn't distinctive (hundreds of document management tools use similar iconography). Also complex to execute well at small sizes (document details + magnifying glass overlaid = too much visual information below 32px).
- **When to reconsider**: If user testing shows TIC professionals don't understand what Qteria does from logo alone and need more literal category signaling. Or if expanding beyond TIC to general document validation where industry context is less clear.
- **Trade-off**: Literal icons provide instant category recognition (see icon, immediately know what product does) but low differentiation (generic, forgettable). Abstract or letterform logos require learning but build unique brand equity.

**Concept selected instead**: Q with subtle validation metaphor (checkmark tail) - hints at function without being literal document icon.

---

**Pure Wordmark with No Distinction (Not Chosen)**:
- **Why not**: Considered "Qteria" in plain Inter Semibold with no visual distinction (all same color, standard typography). While clean and simple, it doesn't differentiate enough. In crowded compliance software market, pure wordmark with standard typography gets lost. Brand needs at least some visual hook (color split, custom letterform, symbol) to be memorable.
- **When to reconsider**: If Qteria becomes household name in TIC industry (like "Stripe" or "Linear") where pure wordmark carries weight from brand reputation alone. Or if we acquire competitor and want to signal merger through simplified unified identity.
- **Trade-off**: Pure wordmarks are ultimate simplicity (easy to scale, reproduce, remember) but require strong existing brand recognition or extremely distinctive name. "Qteria" is good but not inherently visual (unlike "Airbnb" which creates visual with unique spelling).

**Concept selected instead**: Wordmark with color split (terracotta Q) in Concept C, or Q lettermark + wordmark in Concept A - adds just enough visual interest while maintaining clarity.

---

### Color Decisions

**All Blue (No Terracotta Accent) - Not Chosen**:
- **Why not**: Every TIC/compliance tool uses blue (trust, professionalism, industry standard). While blue is appropriate and expected, using ONLY blue makes us visually identical to competitors. Brand strategy emphasizes "subtle warmth" (Balkan heritage) and "not generic enterprise" - terracotta accent achieves both. Differentiation matters in competitive market.
- **When to reconsider**: If user testing shows terracotta accent confuses TIC professionals or feels "off-brand" for compliance context. Or if expanding internationally to cultures where terracotta/orange has negative associations.
- **Trade-off**: All-blue is safest choice (never wrong in B2B/compliance) but doesn't differentiate. Blue + warm accent is distinctive but slightly riskier (must execute well to avoid feeling unprofessional).

**Concept selected instead**: Blue as primary + terracotta as strategic accent (logo tail, rare UI highlights) - professional with personality.

---

**Bright/Vibrant Colors (Not Chosen)**:
- **Why not**: Brand personality is professional, serious, trustworthy - not playful or casual. Target audience (Project Handlers and Process Managers at notified bodies) works in regulated compliance environment. Bright colors (bright orange, lime green, hot pink) signal consumer products or creative agencies, not quality management tools. Would undermine authority and trust.
- **When to reconsider**: If Qteria launches consumer-facing brand (helping general public understand certification process) or targets startup TIC companies with younger teams who prefer modern/energetic aesthetic.
- **Trade-off**: Bright colors stand out in crowded market (high attention-grabbing) but can feel inappropriate for serious/professional contexts. Muted professional colors are safer but require other differentiation (strong product, great brand strategy, unique features).

**Concept selected instead**: Professional blue + muted terracotta (warm but not bright) + grays.

---

**Monochrome (Gray/Black Only) - Not Chosen**:
- **Why not**: While monochrome is elegant and timeless (think Apple's minimalism), it doesn't express the "warmth" aspect of brand personality. Brand strategy specifically calls for "subtle warmth (Balkan heritage)" and "not cold enterprise." All-gray/black would feel too restrained, potentially cold. Also, competitive differentiation is harder in monochrome (less visual distinctiveness without color).
- **When to reconsider**: If brand repositions around extreme minimalism or luxury positioning (premium enterprise tier where restraint = exclusivity). Or if color is causing production cost issues and monochrome is more economical.
- **Trade-off**: Monochrome is ultimate timelessness (black/white/gray never go out of style) and extreme versatility (works in any context) but limits emotional expression (harder to convey warmth, friendliness, approachability without color).

**Concept selected instead**: Color palette with restraint (not bright, but not monochrome) - blue + terracotta + grays balance professionalism with warmth.

---

**Rainbow/Multi-Color (Not Chosen)**:
- **Why not**: Using many colors (Google-style rainbow palette) signals playfulness, creativity, diversity emphasis - doesn't fit "organized quality management professional" personality. Multi-color logos are also harder to reproduce consistently (print costs higher, more color management issues, harder to ensure brand consistency across vendors).
- **When to reconsider**: If brand launches sub-brand targeting educators/trainers (teaching certification concepts) where visual variety aids learning. Or if emphasizing diversity/inclusion becomes core brand value requiring visual expression.
- **Trade-off**: Multi-color is highly distinctive and energetic (impossible to ignore) but hard to execute professionally (can feel chaotic, harder to maintain consistency, higher costs).

**Concept selected instead**: Limited palette (2-3 brand colors max) for clarity and professional restraint.

---

### Typography Decisions

**Serif Font (Not Chosen)**:
- **Why not**: Serif fonts (like Georgia, Garamond, Merriweather) convey traditional authority, heritage, editorial credibility - but feel dated in tech/software context. Target audience expects modern B2B tool (SaaS), not academic journal or law firm. Sans-serif better conveys modern efficiency and digital-native product. Brand personality is "professional" but also "direct" and "organized" - serif feels too formal/stuffy.
- **When to reconsider**: If brand wants to emphasize deep expertise and long history (even though Qteria is new, could borrow authority from TIC industry heritage). Or if launching thought leadership content (research papers, white papers) where serif adds credibility.
- **Trade-off**: Serifs add sophistication and timeless elegance (never "trendy") but can feel dated in software UI and slower to read on screens at small sizes.

**Concept selected instead**: Inter (modern sans-serif, highly legible, B2B standard).

---

**Display/Decorative Font (Not Chosen)**:
- **Why not**: Display fonts (like hand-drawn scripts, decorative headings, ultra-geometric) have strong personality but limited readability at small sizes. Logo must work at 16px (favicon) and display fonts become illegible. Also, decorative fonts feel playful or artistic - doesn't match "competent professional" personality. Brand needs versatility (logo on business card, app icon, billboard) - display fonts only work at large sizes.
- **When to reconsider**: For special campaign where personality trumps versatility (maybe playful sub-brand or event-specific identity). Or if brand pivots to consumer market where warmth/approachability is primary (currently B2B professional is primary).
- **Trade-off**: Decorative fonts have maximum personality and uniqueness (extremely memorable, ownable style) but severely limited application (can't use at small sizes, may feel dated quickly, harder to pair with body copy).

**Concept selected instead**: Clean Inter (versatile across all sizes, professional, highly readable).

---

**Custom Typeface (Not Chosen)**:
- **Why not**: Resource constraints. Custom typeface requires $20K-50K investment and 3-6 months of development with type designer. Solo founder launching MVP - can't justify cost/time for custom typography when Inter serves brand perfectly well. Custom typeface makes sense for massive brands (Airbnb Cereal, Netflix Sans) where unique typography drives differentiation, but pre-revenue startup has better uses for resources.
- **When to reconsider**: Once Qteria scales to $5M+ ARR and typography differentiation becomes competitive advantage. Or if acquired by larger company with budget for brand refinement. Or if licensing costs for Inter become problematic (unlikely - Inter is free and open-source).
- **Trade-off**: Custom fonts are ultimate differentiation (nobody else has your exact typography, builds extreme brand equity) but expensive and time-consuming to create, maintain, and deploy. Standard fonts (Inter) are accessible, well-tested, free, but shared with many brands.

**Concept selected instead**: Inter (professional standard, free, excellent quality).

---

### Visual Style Decisions

**Photography-Heavy Branding (Not Chosen)**:
- **Why not**: Product is software tool for document validation, not lifestyle brand or community platform. The journey is functional (upload docs → validate → fix issues), not emotional/aspirational. Photography-heavy branding fits consumer products (Nike, Patagonia) or people-centric brands (Slack, Airbnb), but Qteria's value is speed + accuracy, not human connection. Also, photography requires ongoing content creation (photoshoots, licensing) - resource constraint for MVP.
- **When to reconsider**: If brand expands to community/events (TIC professional conferences, training) where people are central to brand story. Or if customer testimonials/case studies become primary marketing (showing real users in real workflows).
- **Trade-off**: Photography adds humanity and emotional connection (faces build trust, authenticity) but requires significant content investment (shoots, licensing, asset management) and may not fit functional B2B tools.

**Concept selected instead**: Minimal photography (reserve for marketing website hero sections, about page) - product UI stays clean and photography-free.

---

**Illustration-Heavy (Not Chosen)**:
- **Why not**: Target audience is serious professionals (Project Handlers, Process Managers at notified bodies) in regulated compliance industry. Illustration-heavy branding (like Dropbox, Mailchimp) can feel playful or consumer-oriented - may undermine authority/trust. Also, illustration style requires maintaining consistency over time (hiring illustrators, creating asset library) - resource intensive. And illustrations can date quickly (trendy style becomes outdated).
- **When to reconsider**: If user testing shows TIC professionals struggle with concepts that illustrations could clarify (visual metaphors for AI validation process). Or if onboarding drop-off rate suggests need for friendlier, more approachable visual language.
- **Trade-off**: Illustrations make brands approachable and friendly (breaks down complex concepts, feels human) but can undermine authority/seriousness (may signal "less professional") and require ongoing creation/maintenance (consistency challenge).

**Concept selected instead**: Minimal illustrations (maybe for empty states, onboarding in future) - primary visual language is clean typography, iconography, and structured layouts.

---

**Gradient/Glassmorphism Trend (Not Chosen)**:
- **Why not**: Gradients and glassmorphism (blurred translucent backgrounds) are trendy 2020-2024 but will date quickly. Brand strategy prioritizes timeless design - avoiding trends that will feel outdated in 2-3 years. Also, gradients complicate production (more print colors, harder to reproduce consistently) and can reduce accessibility (gradients over text may hurt contrast/readability).
- **When to reconsider**: If gradient is core to logo meaning (like Concept E's transformation metaphor - blue to terracotta gradient line). Or if refreshing brand in 5+ years and gradients have become timeless (unlikely - most design trends fade).
- **Trade-off**: Gradients feel modern and sophisticated right now (Instagram, iOS design language) but date brands to specific era (gradients were big in 2010s, then out, now back - cyclical). Flat color is more timeless but potentially less visually exciting.

**Concept selected instead**: Flat colors (blue, terracotta, grays) - timeless, accessible, easy to reproduce. Exception: Concept E explores gradient for specific meaning, but flat versions available.

---

**Maximalist/Dense Visual Style (Not Chosen)**:
- **Why not**: Brand values simplicity and clarity (core brand values from strategy). Maximalist design (lots of visual elements, textures, patterns, ornate details) creates cognitive load and competes with content. Journey value is "evidence-based validation" - users need to focus on results, not decorative design. Maximalism fits luxury brands or creative agencies, not functional B2B tools.
- **When to reconsider**: Never for product UI (must stay minimal). Possibly for special marketing campaigns if targeting different audience segment (luxury/premium enterprise tier?). Or if brand becomes so well-known that maximalist expression is clearly "Qteria's bold style" (unlikely path).
- **Trade-off**: Maximalist design is extremely distinctive and memorable (impossible to ignore, strong personality) but overwhelming (high cognitive load, distracts from content, harder to maintain consistency).

**Concept selected instead**: Minimalist visual style - white space, clean typography, subtle patterns at most. Let content (validation results, evidence links) be the focus, not decorative design.

## Appendix

### Journey-Brand Traceability

**How this identity serves the user journey**:

**Journey Step 1** (Process Manager Creates Workflow):
- **Branding appears**: Logo in app navigation (top left), reinforcing they're in Qteria product
- **How it supports**: Professional logo builds trust ("this is a quality tool"). Clean identity matches clean workflow creation UI. Blue-600 CTAs ("Add Criteria") use primary brand color - visual consistency creates confidence.
- **Emotional support**: Organized visual identity (clean logo, structured colors) reinforces user's feeling of control and organization when defining validation workflows.

**Journey Step 2** (Project Handler Uploads Documents):
- **Branding appears**: Logo in navigation, blue-600 upload button ("Upload Documents"), blue-600 progress indicators during upload
- **How it supports**: Consistent brand colors = familiar, trusted. Loading states in blue-600 reassure user action is processing. Clean visual identity doesn't compete with functional task (uploading documents).
- **Emotional support**: Relief - "this tool is organized and professional, it will handle my documents carefully"

**Journey Step 3** (AI Validates Documents) - THE AHA MOMENT:
- **Branding appears**: Logo in navigation, loading animation (optional: Q spinning as quality gate), progress bar in blue-600, status updates in clean Inter typography
- **How it supports**: Professional identity maintains trust during wait. Blue progress bar (brand color) feels consistent with Qteria product. No jarring visual changes - smooth experience.
- **Emotional support**: Confidence building - "the AI is working, this is the real Qteria I trust"

**Journey Step 4** (Results Display with Evidence):
- **Branding appears**: Logo in navigation, semantic colors (green PASS, red FAIL, yellow UNCERTAIN) with icons, evidence links in blue-600, clean typography (Inter for readability)
- **How it supports**:
  - **Evidence-based validation** (core brand value) is visually supported by clear typography - Inter's high legibility ensures "page 8, section 3.2" is readable at 14px
  - **Transparency** (core brand value) is visually supported by semantic colors + icons (never color-only) - accessibility ensures all users can verify results
  - **Professional identity** builds trust in AI results - clean design = careful analysis
- **Emotional support**: "It actually works!" - The clean, professional presentation of evidence makes results feel credible and trustworthy. Brand identity reinforces confidence in validation.

**Journey Step 5** (Project Handler Exports Report):
- **Branding appears**: Logo on exported PDF report (letterhead), brand colors in report formatting (blue headings, semantic status badges)
- **How it supports**: Branded report feels official and professional (can be forwarded to Certification Person with pride). Logo on report builds Qteria brand recognition with secondary audience (Certification Person sees Qteria name repeatedly).
- **Emotional support**: Pride - "I'm handing over a professional, well-validated document package"

### Audience Alignment

**Target Audience** (from journey):
- **Primary**: Project Handlers (daily users, 15-20 assessments/day) and Process Managers (workflow creators) at TIC notified bodies
- **Demographics**: 30-50 years old, quality management professionals, B2B enterprise buyers
- **Psychographics**: Value efficiency + accuracy, anxious about errors slipping through, prefer clarity over complexity

**Why this visual identity appeals to them**:

1. **Professional aesthetic builds trust**: Blue + gray palette signals seriousness and competence (not playful startup). TIC professionals work in regulated environment - they expect professional tools. Logo as quality badge reinforces "this tool understands quality management."

2. **Clean simplicity matches workflow needs**: Project Handlers run 15-20 assessments/day - they need efficient, uncluttered UI. Visual identity is minimal (not decorative) - lets them focus on validation results, not branding. "Get out of my way so I can work" aesthetic.

3. **Subtle warmth prevents cold enterprise feel**: Terracotta accent adds personality - signals "built by someone who understands you" (domain expertise) not "generic enterprise software from big corp." The Balkan warmth metaphor resonates (approachable expert, not cold system).

4. **Evidence-based design matches evidence-based product**: High legibility typography (Inter) ensures evidence text is readable. Semantic colors + icons ensure accessibility. The design itself is transparent (no tricks, no hiding information) - matches brand value of transparency.

5. **Timeless design suggests stability**: TIC professionals make long-term software decisions (not trendy consumers). Avoiding trends (gradients, maximalism) and choosing timeless elements (geometric Q, classic blue/gray, Inter font) signals "we'll be here in 5 years, you can rely on us."

---

### Emotional State Alignment

**When target audience faces journey problem**:
- **Emotional state**: Anxious (quality anxiety - "will errors slip through to Certification Person?"), Frustrated (waiting 1-2 days for India team), Under pressure (15-20 assessments/day to process), Seeking confidence (need to trust validation before forwarding)

**How branding addresses emotional state**:

1. **Quality badge logo**: Q as quality badge/magnifying lens = "we catch everything." Directly addresses quality anxiety. Visual metaphor says "we're thorough, organized, careful" - exactly what anxious user needs to see.

2. **Professional restraint**: Clean, organized visual identity mirrors the organized professional user wants to be. Seeing organized, structured brand = feeling of control and order (counters anxiety/frustration).

3. **Warm accent (not cold)**: Terracotta accent prevents feeling like "just another enterprise tool." Adds human touch - "built by someone who understands your stress." Warmth without undermining authority = supportive expert (matches brand personality).

4. **Clear, direct typography**: Inter's high legibility = ease of reading evidence quickly. No confusion, no squinting, no ambiguity. When user is under pressure (15-20 assessments/day), clear typography reduces cognitive load.

5. **Semantic colors with icons**: Green PASS, Red FAIL immediately understood (traffic light pattern universal). Paired with icons (✓ ✗ ⚠) ensures even in stressful moment, status is unambiguous. No anxiety about "did that pass or fail?"

**Desired outcome** (journey value):
- Fast validation (<10 min), Evidence-based results (click to verify), Confidence to forward documents without embarrassment

**How branding reinforces promise**:
- **Speed**: Clean, minimal branding doesn't slow down UI (efficient design = efficient product)
- **Evidence**: High-contrast blue links (#2563EB on white) make evidence links obvious - user can always verify (transparency value visible in design)
- **Confidence**: Professional logo + consistent branding = trustworthy product. User feels confident saying "I used Qteria" to Certification Person (brand carries authority).

### Competitive Differentiation

**Competitor visual patterns** (from product strategy Session 2):

**Typical compliance/validation tool aesthetics**:
- **Color**: All blue (trust signals) - navy, royal blue, or tech blue. Rarely other colors.
- **Logos**: Document icons, checkmarks, shields, locks (security symbols). Generic and interchangeable.
- **Typography**: Sans-serif (standard) - often Helvetica, Arial, Open Sans (safe, boring).
- **Visual style**: Corporate, conservative, sterile. Lots of gray and white. No personality.

**Specific competitors** (hypothetical - Qteria is creating new category, so competitors are "current alternatives"):
- **India outsourcing teams**: No brand identity (email/WhatsApp communication, no product).
- **Generic document AI tools** (Docparser, PDFTron, etc.): Tech-forward (blues, purples), generic geometric logos, complex dashboards.
- **Enterprise compliance software** (Veeva, MasterControl, etc.): Heavy, corporate aesthetic. Blues, grays, complex navigation. Feels like "big enterprise software" (intimidating, not approachable).

**Our differentiation**:

1. **Q letterform is unique and ownable**:
   - NOT generic document icon (differentiated through distinctive letterform)
   - NOT floating checkmark (Q integrates checkmark as meaningful part of letter)
   - NOT abstract geometric shape with no meaning (Q stands for Quality + Qteria - double meaning)
   - **Result**: Memorable logo that competitors can't copy (letterform is tied to our name)

2. **Terracotta warm accent breaks "all blue" pattern**:
   - Every compliance tool uses blue → we use blue + terracotta
   - Warm accent differentiates visually ("that's the one with the warm accent") while maintaining professionalism
   - **Result**: Stands out in side-by-side comparison (logo more distinctive in competitive slide decks)

3. **Clean minimalism vs. enterprise bloat**:
   - Competitors have complex logos (multiple elements, intricate details)
   - Qteria has simple Q + wordmark (geometric clarity)
   - **Result**: Feels modern and efficient, not heavy/intimidating. Appeals to users tired of bloated enterprise software.

4. **Balkan warmth vs. Silicon Valley cold**:
   - Generic tech tools feel like "built by engineers for engineers" (cold, technical)
   - Qteria feels like "built by quality professional who understands your work" (warm expertise)
   - Visual expression: Terracotta accent, approachable personality, human voice
   - **Result**: Users feel understood and supported, not just "using another tool"

5. **Timeless design vs. trendy tech aesthetics**:
   - Many new AI tools use gradients, glassmorphism, "futuristic" styles (will date quickly)
   - Qteria uses flat colors, geometric shapes, classic typography (timeless)
   - **Result**: Feels stable and reliable (long-term partner) not fly-by-night AI startup

**Balance of convention vs. differentiation**:
- **Convention** (category recognition): Blue color (trust, professionalism expected in TIC), checkmark metaphor (validation understood), clean sans-serif typography (modern B2B)
- **Differentiation** (standing out): Q letterform (unique, ownable), terracotta accent (breaks all-blue pattern), quality badge form (authority + warmth)
- **Result**: Recognizable as "compliance/validation tool" (fits category expectations) but distinctive enough to be remembered ("that's the one with the Q badge")

### Brand Evolution

**Version 1.0** (Current - November 2025):
- **Logo**: Concept A - The Evidence Mark (Q letterform as quality badge + checkmark, with terracotta accent)
- **Color Palette**: Blue-600 primary, terracotta-500 warm accent, grays for structure
- **Typography**: Inter (all applications)
- **Visual Style**: Clean, professional, minimal - white space and structure prioritized
- **Context**: New brand launch, building initial recognition, MVP product, pilot customer (TÜV SÜD)

**Future considerations** (potential evolution paths as brand matures):

**Scenario 1: Q Becomes Iconic (3-5 years, if strong brand recognition)**:
- **Shift**: Move from "Q + wordmark" default to "Q icon only" default (like Nike swoosh, Apple apple)
- **Rationale**: Once "Qteria" is well-known in TIC industry, don't need to teach name every time - Q alone carries brand equity
- **Implementation**: Gradually increase Q-only usage (website favicon, app icon, social media) and reduce wordmark appearances
- **Logo evolution**: Refine Q letterform for even better recognition (perhaps slightly bolder ring, refined checkmark tail angle)

**Scenario 2: International Expansion (2-3 years, if expanding beyond EU/US)**:
- **Shift**: May need to adjust color if terracotta has negative associations in target cultures (research needed)
- **Rationale**: Color meanings vary by culture - orange/terracotta may mean different things in Asia, Middle East, etc.
- **Implementation**: Keep blue as universal primary, potentially adjust warm accent to different hue (or remove accent in certain markets)
- **Logo evolution**: Could create regional variations (Q + localized wordmark for non-Latin alphabets?)

**Scenario 3: Product Expansion (3-5 years, if launching multiple products)**:
- **Shift**: Create product family with consistent branding (Qteria [Product Name] structure)
- **Rationale**: If launching Qteria Compliance, Qteria Audit, Qteria Training - need brand architecture
- **Implementation**: Q logo becomes parent brand, sub-products get color-coded variants (Qteria Compliance = blue, Qteria Audit = terracotta, etc.)
- **Logo evolution**: Q stays consistent (brand anchor), wordmarks vary by product

**Scenario 4: Market Perception Shift (ongoing, based on customer feedback)**:
- **Shift**: If customers perceive brand as "too corporate" or "not innovative enough," could refresh with more modern elements
- **Rationale**: Brand should match customer perception and market positioning
- **Implementation**: Introduce subtle gradient to Q (flat → slight gradient), or increase terracotta accent usage (more warmth)
- **Logo evolution**: Refine without losing recognition - adjust proportions, weights, colors, but keep Q letterform core

**Elements that might change** (flexible as brand evolves):
- Color ratios (increase/decrease terracotta accent based on feedback)
- Typography (could add secondary display font for marketing if Inter feels too generic over time)
- Visual elements (could introduce illustrations, patterns, photography if brand becomes more consumer-facing)
- Logo variations (could add new layouts for specific uses - vertical, square, ultra-wide, etc.)

**Core elements to preserve** (brand equity anchors):
- Q letterform as quality badge + checkmark (this IS the brand - changing would be rebrand, not evolution)
- Professional + approachable balance (never go full playful, never go cold corporate)
- Transparency value (always show evidence, never hide behind complexity)
- Simplicity principle (resist bloat, keep it clean and focused)

**Signals that would indicate need for refresh**:
- Customer feedback: "Logo feels dated" or "doesn't match product quality"
- Competitive shift: All competitors adopt similar visual style (need to differentiate again)
- Product evolution: Features/positioning change significantly (brand no longer matches reality)
- Team growth: Inconsistent brand applications across many people (need stronger guidelines + potential simplification)
- Market expansion: Entering new industries/regions where current identity doesn't resonate

**Refresh cadence recommendation**:
- **Minor refinements**: Every 1-2 years (adjust colors, typography weights, layout tweaks based on usage)
- **Moderate refresh**: Every 3-5 years (refine logo proportions, update color palette, expand visual system)
- **Major rebrand**: Every 7-10 years OR when significant business change occurs (merger, pivot, market repositioning)

**Version control approach**:
- Document all changes in this file (add "Version 1.1 - [Date]" sections as updates occur)
- Maintain archive of old logo files (don't delete previous versions - history matters for IP/trademark)
- Communicate changes to team + customers (especially if logo changes - avoid confusion)
