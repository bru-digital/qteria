## Mission Statement

We help Project Handlers at TIC notified bodies
validate certification documents 400x faster
by transforming manual compliance checks into AI-powered assessments with evidence-based results.

---

## Mission Components

### Who We Serve

- **Primary User**: Project Handlers at TIC (Testing, Inspection, Certification) notified bodies
- **User Context**: Running 15-20 document pre-assessments per day before forwarding to Certification Person
- **Why They Need This**: Currently wait 1-2 days for outsourced India teams ($100K/year) to perform basic validation, creating pipeline bottlenecks and quality anxiety when errors slip through

### Value We Deliver

- **Core Outcome**: Evidence-based AI validation in <10 minutes with exact document locations (page, section) for each pass/fail result
- **Measurable Impact**:
  - Time: 1-2 days → 10 minutes (400x faster)
  - Cost: $100K/year → $30K/year (70% savings)
  - Quality: Fewer clarification rounds with Certification Person (measurable via internal tracking)
- **Journey Connection**: Step 3 (Aha Moment) - "Criteria 2: Test summary missing - FAIL → [Link: test-report.pdf, page 8]" - AI provides proof, not just opinion

### How We're Different

- **Unique Approach**:

  1. **Evidence-based validation** - Every AI result links to exact document location (no black-box answers)
  2. **Radical simplicity** - ONLY workflow → buckets → criteria → validate (no feature bloat)
  3. **Enterprise data privacy** - Zero-retention AI, SOC2/ISO 27001 compliance from day one
  4. **White-glove support** - Dedicated relationship manager per customer (not ticket queues)

- **Why It Works**:

  - Evidence builds trust (users verify AI is correct, not guessing)
  - Simplicity enables <30 min workflow creation (Process Managers succeed immediately)
  - Privacy unlocks enterprise sales (notified bodies trust us with confidential certification documents)
  - Personal support creates sticky relationships (NPS 50+)

- **Why It's Defensible**:
  - Evidence-based AI requires specialized PDF parsing engineering (not just API wrapper)
  - Simplicity is hard discipline (competitors add features, we subtract)
  - White-glove service doesn't scale to thousands (perfect for 20-50 enterprise accounts at $30K each)
  - TIC industry insider knowledge (founder understands notified body workflows deeply)

## Mission Tests

### Feature Decision Test

"Does this feature help Project Handlers validate documents faster through evidence-based AI?"

**Example Applications**:

- ✅ **Confidence scoring** (green/yellow/red) → YES - helps Project Handlers trust AI results
- ❌ **Batch processing 50 assessments** → NO - adds complexity, violates simplicity principle
- ✅ **Feedback loop** (flag false positives) → YES - improves AI accuracy, delivers mission outcome better
- ❌ **Custom reporting dashboards** → NO - doesn't accelerate validation, feature creep

### Partnership Decision Test

"Does this partnership serve Project Handlers or advance faster validation?"

**Example Applications**:

- ✅ **Integration with certification project management tools** → YES - streamlines workflow for Project Handlers
- ❌ **Integration with generic document management** → NO - not specific to TIC validation use case
- ✅ **Partnership with TÜV SÜD for co-development** → YES - serves primary user, validates product-market fit

### Hiring Decision Test

"Does this role directly contribute to delivering faster, evidence-based validation?"

**Example Applications**:

- ✅ **Backend engineer** (PDF parsing, AI integration) → YES - enables core mission delivery
- ✅ **Customer success manager** (white-glove support) → YES - delivers differentiated support, mission-critical for retention
- ❌ **Marketing coordinator** (social media) → NO (not yet) - doesn't directly accelerate validation. Hire when $150K+ ARR validates need for demand gen.
- ✅ **AI/ML engineer** (improve accuracy) → YES - reduces false positives/negatives, delivers mission outcome better

## Mission in Practice

### What We Say YES To:

- Features that reduce validation time (current: <10 min, goal: <5 min)
- Features that improve evidence clarity (better page/section linking, visual annotations)
- Features that increase AI accuracy (<5% false positive, <1% false negative)
- Features that maintain simplicity (remove steps, don't add)
- Customers who value speed + privacy + simplicity (TIC notified bodies, MedTech consulting)

### What We Say NO To:

- Features unrelated to validation speed/accuracy (e.g., project management, team collaboration chat)
- Customers who want "everything in one platform" (not our mission - stay focused)
- Integrations that don't serve Project Handlers or Process Managers directly
- Pricing models that don't align with value delivered (don't charge per user if value is per assessment)
- Technologies that sacrifice data privacy for convenience (no consumer AI APIs without zero-retention)

---

**Connection to Other Strategy**:

- **From User Journey**: Mission addresses Step 3 (AI Validates & Returns Evidence-Based Results) where primary value is delivered - Project Handlers get exact issue locations in <10 minutes instead of waiting 1-2 days
- **To North Star Metric**: "Active Assessments Per Month" directly measures mission fulfillment - more assessments = more documents validated faster
- **To Monetization**: We charge $30K/year per notified body when they use the platform to validate documents (annual subscription tied to value delivery, not per-assessment to avoid usage anxiety)
- **To Product Principles**: Mission drives "Evidence Over Opinion" principle (users trust what they can verify) and "Simplicity Over Features" (faster validation through focused tool, not bloated platform)
