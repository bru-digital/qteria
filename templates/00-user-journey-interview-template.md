# User Journey Interview Template

> **Purpose**: A structured framework for conducting user interviews to define the complete user journey. Use this template to systematically gather information needed to complete `00-user-journey.md`.

---

## Interview Framework

This template guides you through a progressive interrogation process to understand your users deeply and map their complete journey from problem to value realization.

**Interview Style**:

- Ask questions one at a time
- Listen actively and adapt based on responses
- Push for specificity (avoid generic answers)
- Quantify value wherever possible
- Find the "aha moment" (usually Step 3 in the flow)

---

## Phase 1: Understand the Problem

### Question 1: Problem & User Identification

**Ask**: "What problem are you solving? For whom specifically?"

**Follow-ups if needed**:

- "Can you describe a specific person who has this problem?"
- "What's their role/title?"
- "What's their day-to-day context?"

**What you're looking for**:

- Specific user persona (not "everyone" or "businesses")
- Clear role and context
- Real human with identifiable characteristics

**Example good answer**: "Compliance officers at mid-sized financial services firms who review 20-50 regulatory documents monthly"

**Example bad answer**: "Anyone who needs to process documents faster"

---

### Question 2: Current State & Workarounds

**Ask**: "How do they solve this today? What's their current workaround?"

**Follow-ups if needed**:

- "Walk me through their current process step by step"
- "How long does it take them?"
- "What tools do they use?"
- "What's the most painful part?"

**What you're looking for**:

- Detailed understanding of current workflow
- Pain level assessment (is this a vitamin or painkiller?)
- Specific friction points in current solution
- Time/cost of current approach

**Example good answer**: "They manually read 50+ page documents, cross-reference against spreadsheets of compliance requirements, takes 2-4 hours per document, high risk of missing critical issues"

**Example bad answer**: "They do it manually and it's slow"

---

### Question 3: Trigger & Urgency

**Ask**: "What triggers them to seek a new solution? What's the cost of not solving this?"

**Follow-ups if needed**:

- "Why can't they continue with their current approach?"
- "What breaks if they don't solve this?"
- "Is this a nice-to-have or a must-have?"
- "What's at stake?"

**What you're looking for**:

- Problem urgency (hair on fire? or mild annoyance?)
- Economic impact of the problem
- Risk factors
- Compelling event that drives adoption

**Example good answer**: "If they don't approve documents quickly, it delays business deals. But if they rush and miss compliance issues, they risk regulatory fines of $50K+. They're stuck between speed and thoroughness."

**Example bad answer**: "It would be nice to save some time"

---

### Question 4: Success Definition

**Ask**: "What does success look like for them? How will they know it worked?"

**Follow-ups if needed**:

- "What specific outcome are they trying to achieve?"
- "How would they measure success?"
- "What would make them tell their colleague 'you have to try this'?"

**What you're looking for**:

- Concrete success criteria
- Measurable outcomes
- Emotional payoff
- Potential metrics

**Example good answer**: "Assess a document in <10 minutes instead of 2-4 hours, with 95%+ confidence they didn't miss anything critical"

**Example bad answer**: "They'd be happier"

---

### Question 5: Initial Flow Mapping

**Ask**: "Walk me through how they'd use your solution. What's step 1? Then what?"

**Follow-ups if needed**:

- "What happens next?"
- "How long should that take?"
- "What could go wrong at that step?"
- "When do they first get value?"

**What you're looking for**:

- Beginning of the user flow
- Entry point to your solution
- First interactions
- Path toward value

**Example good answer**: "They'd upload the PDF document, select which compliance frameworks to check against, then get an instant assessment with flagged issues"

**Example bad answer**: "They'd log in and use the features"

---

## Phase 2: Map the Complete Journey

### Question 6: Entry Point Details

**Ask**: "What's the very first thing they do? How do they start?"

- Core value delivery
- Emotional peak in the journey
- The reason they'll pay and return

**Record**:

- User Action:
- System Response:
- User Feels:
- **Value Delivered**: ← THIS IS THE CORE VALUE
- Potential Friction:

**Time to Value Target**: \_\_\_ minutes from entry to aha moment

---

### Question 9: Value Reinforcement

**Ask**: "After they get that initial value, what do they do next?"

## Interview Tips

### Push for Specificity

- ❌ "Businesses need this" → ✅ "Which businesses? What size? What industry?"
- ❌ "It's inefficient" → ✅ "How long does it take? What's the cost?"
- ❌ "Users want speed" → ✅ "How fast? Current state vs. desired state?"

### Quantify Everything

- Time: "2-4 hours → 3 minutes" (not "much faster")
- Money: "$450 saved per document" (not "saves money")
- Frequency: "30 documents per month" (not "many documents")
- Confidence: "95%+ accuracy" (not "more confident")

### Find the Human Need

- If they say "I want to build X", ask "Why? For whom? What problem does it solve?"
- If they describe features, ask "Why does that matter to the user?"
- If they mention technology, redirect to user value: "How does that help your user?"

### Validate the Aha Moment

- This is usually Step 3 in the journey
- It should be specific: "When they see the compliance report generated in 60 seconds"
- Not generic: "When they use the product"
- Should create emotional response: amazed, relieved, empowered

### Calculate Value Ratio

This is critical! Must be 10:1 or higher.

**Formula**: (Value delivered per month) ÷ (Price per month) = Ratio

**Example**:

- Time saved: 90 hours/month × $150/hour = $13,500/month value
- Price: $200/month
- Value ratio: $13,500 ÷ $200 = 67:1 ✓ Excellent!

If ratio is below 10:1, either:

- You haven't quantified value fully, or
- Your pricing is too high, or
- The problem isn't valuable enough

## Example Interview Snippet

**Interviewer**: "What problem are you solving? For whom specifically?"

**Founder**: "I want to help people process documents faster with AI."

**Interviewer**: "Let's get more specific. Who exactly has this document processing problem? Can you describe a specific person?"

**Founder**: "Compliance officers at financial services companies. They have to review a lot of regulatory documents."

**Interviewer**: "Perfect. How do they handle this today?"

**Founder**: "They manually read through everything, cross-referencing against compliance frameworks. Takes forever."

**Interviewer**: "How long exactly? Give me a specific example."

**Founder**: "A typical 50-page vendor contract takes 2-4 hours to assess against SOC2 and GDPR requirements."

**Interviewer**: "What's the cost if they don't solve this problem?"

**Founder**: "Two costs: First, slow reviews delay business deals - opportunity cost. Second, if they rush and miss a compliance issue, the company could face regulatory fines of $50K or more."

**Interviewer**: "So they're stuck between speed and accuracy. What would success look like?"

**Founder**: "They could assess that same document in under 10 minutes with confidence they caught 95%+ of issues."

**Interviewer**: "Great! Walk me through how they'd use your solution. What's step 1?"
