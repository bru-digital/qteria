## Core Architectural Principles

### 1. Journey-Step Optimization

**Principle**: Optimize architecture for critical journey steps, not theoretical scale.

**Application**:

- Step [X]: [Architectural decision]
- Step [Y]: [Architectural decision]

### 2. [Principle Name]

**Principle**: [Principle statement]

**Application**: [How you apply this]

## Data Flow: [Critical Journey Step]

```
1. User [action]
   ↓
2. Frontend → Backend: [API call]
   ↓
3. Backend [processing]
   ↓
4. [Service] → [External API]
   ↓
5. Results stored in [database]
   ↓
6. Frontend displays [result]
```

**Why This Architecture**: [Reasoning tied to journey requirements]
