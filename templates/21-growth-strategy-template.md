## Growth Loops

### Primary Loop: [Loop Name]

**Loop Type**: [Viral / Content / Network / Integration / Other]

**Loop Mechanics**:

```
1. [User action in journey]
   ↓
2. [Creates value/content/invite]
   ↓
3. [Attracts new user]
   ↓
4. [New user repeats action]
   ↓
[Loop repeats]
```

**Journey Integration**:

- **Trigger point**: [Which journey step triggers loop?]
- **Mechanism**: [How does it work technically?]
- **User motivation**: [Why would users do this?]

**Example**:
[Concrete example of loop in action]

**Metrics**:

- **Viral coefficient**: [X new users per existing user per month]
- **Cycle time**: [Y days for one loop cycle]
- **Participation rate**: [Z% of users who trigger loop]

**Optimization Tactics**:

1. [Tactic to increase participation rate]
2. [Tactic to decrease cycle time]
3. [Tactic to increase viral coefficient]

**Current State**: [Baseline metrics if known]

**Target State** (6 months): [Goal metrics]

---

### Secondary Loop: [Loop Name] (Optional)

[Same structure as primary loop]

---

### What We DIDN'T Choose (And Why)

#### ❌ [Loop Not Chosen 1]

**Why not**: [Journey doesn't support this loop because...]

**When to reconsider**: [Conditions]

**Example**:

```
❌ Referral Program ($50 credit for referring)
Why not: Journey value is trust-based (compliance), not discount-driven.
Financial incentives misalign with brand values. Users refer organically
through advocacy, not incentives.

When to reconsider: If NPS >70 and unprompted referral rate >15%, could
test non-financial incentives (exclusive features, recognition).
```

---

#### ❌ [Loop Not Chosen 2]

**Why not**: [Reasoning]

**When to reconsider**: [Conditions]

## Acquisition Funnel

### Funnel Overview

```
Awareness (Top of Funnel)
↓ [Conversion rate: X%]
Consideration (Middle of Funnel)
↓ [Conversion rate: Y%]
Trial/Signup (Bottom of Funnel)
↓ [Conversion rate: Z%]
Activation (Aha Moment)
```

**Overall Conversion**: [Awareness → Activation: X%]

---

### Stage 1: Awareness

**Goal**: [Target user] becomes aware of [solution] for [journey problem]

**Channels**:

- [Channel 1]: [Volume] [visitors/impressions] per month

- Awareness → Consideration: [Y]%

---

### Stage 2: Consideration

**Goal**: User evaluates [product] vs. [alternatives] and decides to try

**Key Questions** (user is asking):

1. "Does this solve MY specific problem?" → [How you answer]
2. "How is this different from [alternative]?" → [How you answer]
3. "Can I trust this?" → [How you answer]
4. "What's the effort to get started?" → [How you answer]

**Consideration Assets**:

- **Landing page**: [Headline], [Social proof], [CTA]
- **Comparison page**: vs. [Alternative 1], vs. [Alternative 2]
- **Case studies**: "[Company] achieved [outcome] in [time]"
- **Demo/Video**: "[X]-minute demo showing [journey flow]"

**Objection Handling**:
| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "Too expensive" | [Value ratio: save $X for $Y cost] |
| "Too complex" | "[Time] to first value, zero setup" |
| "Not sure it works" | "Free trial, [X] free [units]" |
| "Security concerns" | "[Compliance certs], [security page]" |

**Metrics**:

- Consideration → Trial: [X]%
- Time on landing page: [Y] seconds (target: >[Z])

---

### Stage 3: Trial/Signup

**Signup Flow**:

1. [Step 1: e.g., "Email + password (or Google SSO)"]
2. [Step 2: e.g., "Optional: Company name"]
3. [Step 3: e.g., "Skip onboarding / Quick tour"]
4. → [User lands in product, ready for journey Step 1]

**Friction Reduction**:

- ❌ No email verification (verify later)
- ❌ No credit card required (freemium model)
- ❌ No lengthy forms (3 fields max)
- ✅ Social login (Google, GitHub)
- ✅ Sample data pre-loaded (try immediately)

**Metrics**:

- Landing page → Signup started: [X]%
- Signup started → Signup completed: [Y]%
- Time to complete signup: [Z] seconds (target: <60s)

---

## Activation Strategy

| ------------------- | ------------------ | -------- | -------- | ---------- |
| Signup complete     | 100%               | -        | -        | -          |
| [Onboarding step 1] | [X]%               | [Y]%     | [Reason] | [Solution] |
| [Onboarding step 2] | [X]%               | [Y]%     | [Reason] | [Solution] |
| Journey Step 1      | [X]%               | [Y]%     | [Reason] | [Solution] |

---

### Activation Tactics

**Onboarding Flow**:

```
Option 1: Guided Tour (For complex products)
→ [Step 1: Welcome + value prop reminder]
→ [Step 2: Interactive tutorial for journey Step 1]
→ [Step 3: Complete first [action] with guidance]
→ [Aha moment reached]

Option 2: Jump to Value (For simple products)
→ [Skip tour button, jump to journey Step 1]
→ [Tooltips on key features]
→ [Sample data pre-loaded]
→ [Aha moment in <5 minutes]
```

**Chosen Approach**: [Option 1 / Option 2 / Hybrid]

**Why**: [Journey complexity, user sophistication, time to value]

**Implementation**:

- [Element 1: e.g., "Progress checklist (3 steps to first value)"]
- [Element 2: e.g., "Sample data pre-loaded"]
- [Element 3: e.g., "Video tutorial (2 min)"]
- [Element 4: e.g., "Email drip (D1, D3, D7 nudges)"]

**Activation Triggers** (for users who drop off):

- **Email 1** (2 hours after signup): "[User], complete your first [action]"
- **Email 2** (24 hours, not activated): "Need help? [Link to guide/video]"
- **Email 3** (3 days, not activated): "See how [Company] uses [product]"
- **In-app notification**: [Prompt to continue onboarding]

---

### What We DIDN'T Choose (And Why)

#### ❌ [Activation Approach Not Chosen]

**Why not**: [Journey/user mismatch reasoning]

**When to reconsider**: [Conditions]

**Example**:

```
❌ Mandatory 10-Minute Onboarding Video
Why not: Journey aha moment is experiential (try it yourself), not
educational (watch video). Users drop off during forced videos. Better
to jump to value, offer video as optional help.

When to reconsider: If analytics show users who watch video have 2x
retention vs. those who skip. Currently, video watchers have LOWER
activation (selection bias - confused users watch videos).
```

---

## Retention Strategy

### Retention Model

**Journey Cadence**: [Daily / Weekly / Monthly / Episodic / Project-based]

**Why Users Return**: [What triggers return to journey Step 1?]

**Retention Metrics**:

- **D1 Retention**: [X]% (users who return day 1)
- **D7 Retention**: [Y]% (target: >[Y+10]%)
- **D30 Retention**: [Z]% (target: >[Z+10]%)
- **Monthly Churn**: [C]% (target: <[C-2]%)

**Retention by Cohort**:
| Cohort | D7 | D30 | D90 | Notes |
|--------|-----|------|------|-------|
| [Month 1] | [X]% | [Y]% | [Z]% | [Context] |
| [Month 2] | [X]% | [Y]% | [Z]% | [Context] |
| [Month 3] | [X]% | [Y]% | - | [Context] |

| ---------------- | ------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Welcome          | Signup        | Activate   | "Complete first [action]"              | [X]% click → aha |
| D3 (not active)  | No aha moment | Re-engage  | "See how others use [product]"         | [Y]% return      |
| D7 (active)      | Reached aha   | Habit      | "[Milestone] reached! Try [feature 2]" | [Z]% return      |
| Weekly digest    | Active users  | Engagement | "Your [stats], new [content]"          | [A]% open        |
| D30 (churn risk) | Low activity  | Rescue     | "Need help? Here's [guide]"            | [B]% return      |

---

### Expanding Usage

**Expansion Paths**:

```
Path 1: Single Use Case → Multiple Use Cases
Current: [X]% of users have >1 use case
Target: [Y]%
Tactics:
- [Suggest related use cases in-product]
- [Email: "Try [use case 2] next"]
- [Blog/guides for adjacent use cases]
```

```
Path 2: Individual User → Team Usage
Current: [X]% of accounts have >1 user
Target: [Y]%
Tactics:
- [Prompt to invite team after aha moment]
- [Collaboration features that require teammates]
- [Team analytics dashboard]
```

```
Path 3: Occasional Use → Frequent Use
Current: [X] uses per user per month
Target: [Y] uses per user per month
Tactics:
- [Integrate into daily workflow]
- [Reminders/notifications for triggers]
- [Habit-forming UI patterns]
```

---

### Resurrection (Win-back Churned Users)

**Churn Reasons** (survey churned users):

1. [Reason 1]: [X]% of churned users
   - **Fix**: [Product improvement / messaging / pricing change]

2. [Reason 2]: [Y]% of churned users
   - **Fix**: [Solution]

**Win-back Campaign**:

- **Target**: Users churned [X-Y] months ago
- **Message**: "[What's new since you left]"
- **Incentive**: [Free month / Extended trial / Feature access]
- **Success rate**: [Target: Z% resurrection]

---

### What We DIDN'T Choose (And Why)

#### ❌ [Retention Tactic Not Chosen]

**Why not**: [Journey/behavior mismatch]

**When to reconsider**: [Conditions]

**Example**:

```
❌ Daily Email Reminders
Why not: Journey cadence is monthly (quarterly audits), not daily. Daily
emails would annoy users and train them to ignore emails. Better: calendar
integration + timely reminders before audit deadlines.

When to reconsider: If expanding to daily use cases (continuous compliance
monitoring vs. quarterly audits). Would need new product features first.
```

## Monetization Optimization

### Current Monetization Model

**Model**: [Freemium / Free trial / Paid / Usage-based / Hybrid]

**Pricing Tiers**:

- **Free**: [Limits] - Goal: [Trial journey value]
- **Paid**: $[X]/[period] - [Limits] - Goal: [Core customers]
- **Enterprise**: $[Y]/[period] - [Limits] - Goal: [Large customers]

**Pricing**: [Cost per additional seat]

---

#### 2. Usage Expansion

**Goal**: [Y]% increase in [usage metric]
**Mechanism**: [How to encourage more usage]
**Pricing**: [Cost per additional usage]

---

#### 3. Feature Upsell

**Goal**: [Z]% of paid users upgrade to premium features
**Features**: [What premium features?]
**Pricing**: [Cost for upgrade]

---

**Net Revenue Retention Target**: [X]% (goal: >110%)

---

### What We DIDN'T Choose (And Why)

#### ❌ [Monetization Approach Not Chosen]

**Why not**: [Journey value misalignment]

**When to reconsider**: [Conditions]

**Example**:

```
❌ Flat Unlimited Pricing ($299/month, unlimited usage)
Why not: Journey value scales with usage (more assessments = more time
saved). Flat pricing creates adverse selection—high-usage users over-
consume, low-usage users churn. Usage-based aligns value with cost.

When to reconsider: If usage variance is low (all customers ~2,000-4,000
assessments/month, tight distribution). Need 12 months data to validate.
Currently, variance is 10x (200-2,000 assessments/month).
```

## Prioritized Growth Experiments

### Experiment Prioritization Framework

**ICE Scoring**: (Impact + Confidence + Ease) / 3

- **Impact** (1-10): How much will this move North Star?
- **Confidence** (1-10): How certain are we it will work?
- **Ease** (1-10): How easy to implement and measure?

---

### Priority 1: [Experiment Name] (ICE: X.X)

**Category**: [Acquisition / Activation / Retention / Monetization / Viral]

**Hypothesis**: [If we do X, then Y will happen because Z]

**Metric**: [Primary metric to measure]

**Success Criteria**: [Metric] from [X] → [Y] ([Z]% improvement)

**Implementation**:

- [Step 1]
- [Step 2]
- [Step 3]

**Timeline**: [X weeks to build, Y weeks to measure]

**Resources**: [Team/time/budget needed]

**ICE Breakdown**:

- Impact: [X]/10 - [Why this score?]
- Confidence: [Y]/10 - [Why this score?]
- Ease: [Z]/10 - [Why this score?]

**Risk**: [What could go wrong?]

**Rollback Plan**: [If experiment fails, how to revert?]

---

### Priority 2: [Experiment Name] (ICE: X.X)

[Same structure as Priority 1]

---

### Priority 3: [Experiment Name] (ICE: X.X)

[Same structure]

---

[Continue for 10-15 experiments, prioritized by ICE score]

---

### What We DIDN'T Choose (And Why)

#### ❌ [Experiment Not Prioritized 1]

**ICE Score**: [X.X] (Low)

**Why not**: [Low impact / Low confidence / High effort / Opportunity cost]

**When to reconsider**: [Conditions]

**Example**:

```
❌ Redesign Entire Landing Page (ICE: 4.3)
Why not: Current landing page converts at 12% (above benchmark).
Redesign is high effort (6 weeks design + dev) with uncertain impact
(could hurt conversion). Better to A/B test incremental changes (headline,
CTA, social proof) before full redesign.

When to reconsider: If conversion drops below 8% OR if targeting new
persona (current page optimized for [persona A], new persona [B] has
different needs).
```

#### ❌ [Experiment Not Prioritized 2]

**Why not**: [Reasoning]

**When to reconsider**: [Conditions]
