## How This Strategy Informs the Cascade

**Using this product strategy with Stack-Driven**:

- **Session 1** (`/refine-journey`): User journey should support strategic goals
- **Session 2** (`/choose-tech-stack`): Tech choices should enable vision
- **Session 3** (`/generate-strategy`): Mission/metrics should align with vision and goals
- **Session 4** (`/create-design`): Design should reflect product principles
- **Session 5** (`/generate-backlog`): Backlog should map to roadmap themes

This document is strategic context. The cascade creates tactical execution.
