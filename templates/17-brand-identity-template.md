## What We DIDN'T Choose (And Why)

### Logo Type Decisions

**Abstract Symbol (Not Chosen)**:
- **Why not**: [e.g., "Brand is new and needs name recognition. Abstract symbols require years of marketing investment to build meaning."]
- **When to reconsider**: [e.g., "If brand becomes well-known and wants to simplify to iconic mark (like Nike swoosh)"]
- **Trade-off**: Abstract symbols are memorable once established, but risky for new brands

**Complex Illustration (Not Chosen)**:
- **Why not**: [e.g., "Doesn't scale well to small sizes (favicon, app icon). Brand values clarity over ornamentation."]
- **When to reconsider**: [e.g., "If targeting consumer audience that values craft and personality over corporate professionalism"]
- **Trade-off**: Detailed illustrations can be charming but limit versatility

**Trendy Geometric Style (Not Chosen)**:
- **Why not**: [e.g., "Geometric overlapping shapes feel dated quickly. We prioritize timeless design."]
- **When to reconsider**: [e.g., "If brand positioning changes to emphasize cutting-edge innovation"]
- **Trade-off**: Trendy designs get attention but age poorly

### Color Decisions

**Blue (Not Chosen)**:
- **Why not**: [e.g., "Every competitor uses blue to signal trust. We differentiate through [chosen color] which expresses [brand personality]."]
- **When to reconsider**: [e.g., "If market research shows audience in [industry] strongly distrusts non-blue brands"]
- **Trade-off**: Blue is safe and trusted, but doesn't differentiate in crowded markets

**Bright/Vibrant Colors (Not Chosen)**:
- **Why not**: [e.g., "B2B audience in [industry] expects professional restraint. Bright colors feel consumer-focused."]
- **When to reconsider**: [e.g., "If pivoting to B2C or targeting younger demographic"]
- **Trade-off**: Vibrant colors stand out but may not convey appropriate professionalism

**Monochrome (Not Chosen)**:
- **Why not**: [e.g., "Brand personality includes [trait like 'warm' or 'friendly'] which needs color to express."]
- **When to reconsider**: [e.g., "If brand repositions around extreme minimalism or luxury"]
- **Trade-off**: Monochrome is elegant and timeless but limits emotional expression

### Typography Decisions

**Serif Font (Not Chosen)**:
- **Why not**: [e.g., "Sans-serif better conveys modern efficiency. Serif feels traditional/formal, not aligned with innovation positioning."]
- **When to reconsider**: [e.g., "If brand wants to emphasize heritage, expertise, or editorial authority"]
- **Trade-off**: Serifs add sophistication but can feel dated in tech contexts

**Display/Decorative Font (Not Chosen)**:
- **Why not**: [e.g., "Limits readability at small sizes. Brand needs versatility across contexts."]
- **When to reconsider**: [e.g., "For special campaigns or sub-brands where personality trumps versatility"]
- **Trade-off**: Decorative fonts have strong personality but limited application

**Custom Typeface (Not Chosen)**:
- **Why not**: [e.g., "Resource constraints. Custom typeface requires $20K-50K investment and months of development."]
- **When to reconsider**: [e.g., "Once brand scales to point where unique typography drives differentiation (like Airbnb Cereal)"]
- **Trade-off**: Custom fonts are ultimate differentiation but expensive to create and maintain

### Visual Style Decisions

**Photography-Heavy Branding (Not Chosen)**:
- **Why not**: [e.g., "Product is software tool, not lifestyle. Photography would feel disconnected from user journey."]
- **When to reconsider**: [e.g., "If brand expands to community/events where people are the story"]
- **Trade-off**: Photography adds humanity but requires ongoing content creation

**Illustration-Heavy (Not Chosen)**:
- **Why not**: [e.g., "Target audience is [serious professionals] who may see illustrations as unprofessional"]
- **When to reconsider**: [e.g., "If onboarding data shows users struggle with concepts that illustrations could clarify"]
- **Trade-off**: Illustrations make brands approachable but can undermine authority
