# LinkedIn Post: When AI Helps You Find What's Really Broken

🔴 Our entire product development stopped for 24 hours. The system kept screaming "CRITICAL ERROR!"

The error message was lying to us.

Here's what happened when we brought in AI to help investigate:

**What we saw:** "You're about to delete production data!"
**What we did:** Fixed the safety checks
**Result:** Still broken ❌

**Then Claude (AI) noticed:** "There's actually an earlier problem hiding in your logs"
**We looked deeper:** Found a completely different issue
**Result:** Getting warmer 🟡

**Four layers deep:** The REAL problem was like finding a broken pipe causing a leak three rooms away
**Result:** Fixed! ✅

## The Universal Problem-Solving Question

Before fixing ANYTHING in business, always ask:
**"Is this the CAUSE or the EFFECT?"**

The loud alarm = EFFECT
The obvious problem = EFFECT
The quick fix = BANDAID
The hidden root issue = CAUSE ✅

## 3 Lessons for Working with AI Tools

1. **The first problem you see is rarely the real problem** - Like a fever isn't the illness, it's a symptom

2. **AI needs context to help effectively** - Imagine asking a consultant to solve a problem but only showing them the last email. Give them the whole story.

3. **Document what doesn't work** - Your failed attempts become guardrails for the next person (or AI) trying to help

We transformed this crisis into a systematic approach: Always dig at least 4 layers deep.

Result: Problems that took 24 hours now take 2 hours.

Sometimes the best failures teach you how to prevent their entire family tree. 🚀

_When has the "obvious" problem in your work turned out to be something completely different?_
