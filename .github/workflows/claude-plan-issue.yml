          # Direct prompt for planning
          direct_prompt: |
            Create a detailed implementation plan for GitHub issue #${{ steps.get-issue.outputs.issue_number }}.

            Please analyze the issue and create a comprehensive plan that includes:

            ## 1. Problem Analysis
            - What is the core problem or feature being requested?
            - What are the key requirements and acceptance criteria?
            - Are there any ambiguities that need clarification?

            ## 2. Technical Approach
            - What is the recommended technical solution?
            - What are the key components/files that need to be modified or created?
            - Are there any architectural considerations?
            - What are potential alternative approaches and why is this one preferred?

            ## 3. Implementation Steps
            Create a numbered list of concrete implementation steps:
            - Each step should be specific and actionable
            - Include file paths and function/component names where applicable
            - Order steps logically (e.g., backend before frontend, models before controllers)
            - Estimate complexity (simple/moderate/complex) for each step

            ## 4. Testing Strategy
            - What types of tests are needed? (unit, integration, E2E)
            - What are the critical test cases to cover?
            - Are there edge cases that need special attention?

            ## 5. Dependencies & Risks
            - Are there dependencies on other issues or features?
            - What are potential technical risks or blockers?
            - Are there any third-party dependencies needed?

            ## 6. Acceptance Criteria Checklist
            Convert the issue's acceptance criteria into a checklist format that can be used to track progress.

            ## 7. Estimated Effort
            - Provide a rough time estimate (e.g., 2-4 hours, 1-2 days)
            - Break down by implementation, testing, and documentation

            ---

            **Context from CLAUDE.md:**
            - Follow the product mission: Help Project Handlers validate documents faster through evidence-based AI
            - Use the tech stack: Next.js 14+, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, TypeScript strict mode
            - Ensure multi-tenancy security (100% test coverage for data isolation)
            - Reference the user journey (5 steps) to ensure feature alignment
            - Apply the mission test: "Does this help validate documents faster through evidence-based AI?"

            **Coding Standards:**
            - TypeScript strict mode (no plain JavaScript)
            - Co-located unit tests with business logic
            - API-first design with versioned endpoints (/v1/)
            - Evidence-based architecture (everything traceable to page/section in PDFs)

            Please post this plan as a comment on the issue. Be thorough but concise.
