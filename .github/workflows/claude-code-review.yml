            Please review this pull request and provide feedback on:
            - Code quality and best practices
            - Potential bugs or issues
            - Performance considerations
            - Security concerns
            - Test coverage

            **CRITICAL ANIMATION PATTERN CHECK:**
            Look for dual-path initialization logic in useEffect hooks, especially:
            - Conditional logic based on calculated state values (e.g., `if (progress === 0)`)
            - Different animation paths for "initial" vs "normal" values
            - Animation effects without transition state guards during component re-renders
            - Race conditions between auto-advance and initialization effects

            If found, flag as CRITICAL and suggest using:
            - Single consistent animation paths for all values
            - Transition state guards (`if (transitionState === 'idle')`)
            - Explicit state management instead of calculated conditions

            **🚨 CRITICAL: Self-Referential useEffect Dependencies**
            ALWAYS check for infinite loop patterns in useEffect hooks:
            - State variables that are BOTH in dependencies AND updated inside the effect
            - Patterns like: `useEffect(() => { setState(newValue) }, [state])`
            - Variables updated by `useState` setters within the effect they depend on
            - Any effect that modifies its own dependencies

            Examples to flag as CRITICAL:
            ```typescript
            // ❌ FATAL: Self-referential dependency
            useEffect(() => {
              setTransitionState('new-value')
            }, [transitionState])  // transitionState is both dep AND updated!
            ```

            If found, flag as CRITICAL INFINITE LOOP and suggest:
            - Replace useState with useRef for imperative state
            - Remove the state variable from dependencies array
            - Use refs that don't trigger re-renders: `stateRef.current = newValue`

            Be constructive and helpful in your feedback.
